            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>A Noble <hi>Venetian,</hi> not one of the young Fry, but a grave ſober perſon, who had born Office and Magiſtracy in his own Commonwealth, having been ſome years ſince in <hi>France</hi> with a near Relation of his who was Ambaſſadour at that Court, and finding himſelf out of Employment, reſolved to divert himſelf by viſiting ſome part of the World which he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen; and ſo paſſing through <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> arrived in <hi>England</hi> about the beginning of
<hi>May</hi> laſt, bringing Letters of recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſeveral
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen, who had been Travellers, and made Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in his Countrey. A Cuſtom uſually pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed amongſt ſuch who travel into any part where they have no habitude or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. Amongſt the reſt, he was addreſſed to one of the Gentlemen who acts a part in this Dialogue: Who after he had waited upon him, and ſerved <pb n="2" facs="tcp:107138:5"/>him for near two Moneths, had certain neceſſary occaſions, which called him for ſome time into the Country. Where he had not been above three Weeks, before he heard, by meer accident, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of <hi>Venice</hi> was fallen dangerous ſick of a malignant Feaver. Which made him poſt away immediately to <hi>London,</hi> to aſſiſt and ſerve him in what he might. But he found him almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reſtored to his health by an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Phyſician of our Nation, as renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Skill and Cures at home; as for his Writings both here and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: And who beſides his profound knowledge in all Learning, as well in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Profeſſions as his own, had particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly arriv'd to ſo exact and perfect a diſcovery of the formerly hidden parts of human Bodies, that every one who can but underſtand Latine, may by his means know more of Anatomy than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> or any of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents or Moderns did, or do perceive. And if he had lived in the days of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> that great Philoſopher would never have ſaid,

                  <p>I am Infinitely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to you, for your care of me, but am ſorry it has been ſo inconvenient to you, as to make you leave your Affairs in the Countrey ſooner than you propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to your ſelf to do: I wiſh I might be ſo fortunate in the courſe of my Life, as to find an opportunity of making ſome part of an acknowledgment, for this and all the reſt of your favours, but ſhall pray God it may not be in the ſame kind; but that your health may ever be ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, that you never need ſo tranſcendent a Charity, as I now receive from your Goodneſs: And as to this incomparable Doctor; although, I muſt confeſs, that <pb n="5" facs="tcp:107138:6"/>all the good which has happen'd to me in this Country, as well as the knowledge I have received of Perſons and Things, does derive from you; yet I muſt make an exception, as to this one point; for if I can either read, or hear, this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's excellent Writings, and the Fame he worthily injoys in my Country, would have made it inexcuſable in me, to implore the help of any other; and I do aſſure you, that, before I left <hi>England,</hi> it was in my Ambition to beg your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation towards the bringing me into the acquaintance and favour of this Learned Perſon, even before I had any thoughts of becoming the Object of his Care and Skill, as now I am the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of both.</p>

                  <p>Well, Gentlemen, you are both too great to be Flatterers, and I too little to be flattered, and therefore I will impute this fine diſcourſe you both make about me, to the overflowing of your Wit, and the having no Object near you to vent it upon but me. And for you, Sir, if my Art fail me not, the voiding this Mirth, is a very good ſign that you are in a fair way to a perfect recovery. <pb n="6" facs="tcp:107138:7"/>And for my Countryman here: I hope whilſt he has this vent, that his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condriack diſtemper will be at quiet, and that neither his own thoughts, nor the ill poſture of our Publick Affairs will make him hang himſelf, for at leaſt this twelve Months: Only, Gentlemen, pray take notice, that this does not paſs upon me, nor do I drink it like Milk (as the <hi>French</hi> phraſe it) being mindful of what a grave Gentleman at <hi>Florence</hi> replyed to a young Eſquire, who anſwered his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments with, <hi>Oh, Sir, you flatter me, i prencipt s'adulano i pari voſtri ſi coglio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nono;</hi> That laſt word I cannot render well into

                  <p>Well, Doctor, we will not offend your Modeſty: The next time we do you Juſtice, it ſhall be behind your back, ſince you are ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere upon us. But you may aſſure your ſelf that my intention of recommending you to this Gentleman, was for his own ſake, and not for yours: For you have too many Patients already, and it were much better, both for you and us, that you had but half ſo many: For then we ſhould have more of your Writings, and <pb n="7" facs="tcp:107138:7"/>ſometimes enjoy your good Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which is worth our being ſick on purpoſe for. And I am reſolved to put my ſelf ſometimes into my Bed, and ſend for you, ſince you have done coming to our Coffee-Houſe.</p>
                  <p>But to leave this Subject now, I hear you ſay, that this Gentleman is in a perfect way of recovery; pray is he well enough to hear, without any prejudice to his convaleſcence, a reprehenſion I have to make him?</p>

                  <speaker>Eng. Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>Then, Sir, pray conſider what ſatisfaction you can ever make me, for the hard meaſure you have uſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, in letting me learn from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fame and Fortune, the news of your Sickneſs, and that not till your recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and for depriving me of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of paying the debt I owe to your own merit, and to the recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe worthy Perſons in <hi>Italy,</hi> who did me the honour to addreſs you to me. And this injury is much aggravated by <pb n="8" facs="tcp:107138:8"/>the ſplendour of your Condition, and greatneſs of your Fortune, which makes it impoſſible for me ever to hope for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other occaſion to expreſs my faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervice to you, or ſatisfie any part of the duty I have to be at your devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

It was not, I ſay, any of theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which hindred me from adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing you of my Diſtemper; but the Condition and Nature of it, which in a moment depriv'd me of the exerciſe of thoſe Faculties which might give me a Capacity of helping my ſelf in any thing. <pb n="9" facs="tcp:107138:8"/>But otherwiſe I aſſure you that no day of my life ſhall paſs, wherein I will not expreſs a ſence of your Favours, and—</p>

                  <p>Pray now, Sir, permit me to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt you; for this Gentleman, I dare ſay, looks for no Compliments; but that which I have to ſay, is; That the deſire you ſignified to me, to give you ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our Affairs here, and the turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of our preſent State, will be much better placed, if you pleaſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs it to this Gentleman whoſe Parts and Studies have fitted him for ſuch an Employment; beſides his having had a great ſhare in the managing Affairs of State here, in other times: And really no man underſtands the Government of <hi>England</hi> better than he.</p>

                  <p>Now, Doctor, I ſhould tell you, <hi>i pari miei ſi coglionono,</hi> for ſo you your ſelf have baptized this kind of Civility; But however, this is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince that I cannot be reaſonably preſt to take upon me, whilſt you are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, who are very well known to be as skillful in the Nature and Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Body Politick, as the whole
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107138:9"/>Nation confeſſes you to be in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the Natural. And you would have good ſtore of Practice in your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Capacity, if the wiſe Cuſtom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> were not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally out of uſe. For they, when they found any Crazineſs or indiſpoſition in their ſeveral Governments, before it broke out into a Diſeaſe, did repair to the Phyſicians of State (who, from their Profeſſion, were called the Seven Wiſe Men of <hi>Greece</hi>) and obtain'd from them ſome good
<hi>Recipes</hi> to prevent thoſe ſeeds of diſtemper from taking root, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the publique Peace. But in our days, theſe Signes or Forerunners of Diſeaſes in State are not foreſeen, till the whole Maſs is corrupted, and that the Patient is incurable, but by violent Remedies. And if we could have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the firſt Symptoms of our Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and uſed good Alteratives, the curioſity of this worthy Gentleman had been ſpared, as alſo his command to you, to give him ſome light into our matters; and we unfortunate <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in that quiet, eaſe, and ſecurity, which we enjoy'd three hundred years
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107138:9"/>ſince. But let us leave the conteſt who ſhall inform this Gentleman, leſt we ſpend the time we ſhould do it in unprofitably, and let each of us take his part; for if we ſpeak all, it will look like a ſtudied diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe fitted for the Preſs, and not a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Dialogue. For it ought to be in private Converſation, as it was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the planting the Goſpel, when there were two ſorts of preaching; the one Concionary, which was uſed by the Apoſtles and other Miſſionaries, when they ſpoke to thoſe who had never heard of the Myſteries of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, poſſibly not ſo much as of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Law, or the Hiſtory of Chriſt: The duty of thoſe was to hear, and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, or any way interrupt the harrangue: But when the Believers (called the Church) aſſembled together, it was the Cuſtom of ſuch of the Auditors, to whom any thing occurred, or (as <hi>S. Paul</hi> calls it) was revealed, to interpoſe and deſire to be heard, which was called an Interlocutory Preaching, or Religious Converſation; and ſerved very much to the inſtructing and edifying thoſe who had long believed in Chriſt, and poſſibly <pb n="12" facs="tcp:107138:10"/>knew as much of him as their Paſtor himſelf; and this is uſed ſtill amongſt many of our Independent Congregations.</p>

                  <speaker>Noble Ven.</speaker>
                  <p>Then, Sir, my firſt requeſt to you, is, That you will vouchſafe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint me for what Reaſons this Nation, which hath over been eſteemed (and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juſtly) one of the moſt conſiderable People of the World, and made the beſt Figure both in Peace, Treaties, War, and Trade, is now of ſo ſmall regard, and ſignifies ſo little abroad? Pardon the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom I take, for I aſſure you it is not out of diſreſpect, much leſs of contempt that I ſpeak it: For ſince I arrived in
<hi>England,</hi> I find it one of the moſt flouriſhing King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in
<hi>Europe,</hi> full of ſplendid Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Gentry; the comlieſt perſons alive, Valiant, Courteous, Knowing and Bountiful; and as well ſtored with Commoners, Honeſt, Induſtrious, fitted for Buſineſs, Merchandiſe, Arts, or Arms; as their ſeveral Educations lead them. Thoſe who apply themſelves to ſtudy, prodigious for Learning, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to admiration in the perfection of all Sciences: All this makes the Riddle impoſſible to be ſolved; but by ſome skillful <hi>Sphynx,</hi> ſuch as you are; whoſe pains I will yet ſo far ſpare, as to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that I do in that little time I have <pb n="17" facs="tcp:107138:12"/>ſpent here, perceive that the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate cauſe of all this, is the Diſ-union of the People and the Governours; the Diſcontentment of the Gentry, and Turbulency of the Commonalty; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though without all Violence or Tumult, which is Miraculous. So that what I now requeſt of you, is, That you will pleaſe to deduce particularly to me, the Cauſes of this Diviſion, that when they are laid open, I may proceed (if you think fit to permit it) from the Diſeaſe, when known, to enquire out the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies.</p>

                  <speaker>Eng. Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>Before I come to make you any Anſwer, I muſt thank you for the Worthy and Honourable Character you give of our Nation, and ſhall add to it, That I do verily believe, that there are not a more Loyal and Faithful People to their Prince in the whole world, than ours are; nor that fear more to fall into that State of Confuſion, in which we were twenty years ſince; and that, not only this Parliament, which conſiſts of the moſt Eminent Men of the Kingdom, both for Eſtates and Parts; but all the Inhabitants of this Iſle in general; even <pb n="18" facs="tcp:107138:13"/>thoſe (ſo many of them as have their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings yet entire) which were of the Anti-royal Party, in our late Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, have all of them the greateſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour imaginable, to think of doing any thing, that may bring this poor Country into thoſe Dangers and Uncertainties, which then did threaten our Ruin; and the rather for this Conſideration; that neither the Wiſdom of ſome, who were engaged in thoſe Affairs, which I muſt aver to have been very great, nor the ſucceſs of their Conteſt, which ended in an abſolute Victory, could prevail, ſo as to give this Kingdom any advantage; nay, not ſo much as any ſettlement, in Satisfaction and Requital of all the Blood it had loſt, Mony it had ſpent, and Haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard it had run. A clear Argument why we muſt totally exclude a Civil War from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of the Remedies, when we come to that point. I muſt add further, That as we have as loyal ſubjects as are any where to be found, ſo we have as gracious and good a Prince: I never having yet heard that he did, or attempted to do, any the leaſt Act of Arbitrary Power, in any publick Concern; nor did ever <pb n="19" facs="tcp:107138:13"/>take, or endeavour to take from any particular perſon the benefit of the Law. And for his only Brother (although acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally he cannot be denyed to be a great motive of the Peoples unquietneſs) all men muſt acknowledge him to be a moſt Glorious and Honourable Prince; one who has expoſed his life ſeveral times for the Safety and Glory of this Nation; one who pays juſtly and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually his Debts, and manages his own Fortune diſcreetly; and yet keeps the beſt Court and Equipage of any Subject in Chriſtendom; is Courteous and Affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all; and in fine, has nothing in his whole Conduct to be excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, much leſs dreaded; excepting, that he is believed to be of a Religion contrary to the Honour of God, and the Safety and intereſt of this People, which gives them juſt Apprehenſions of their Future Condition: But of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we ſhall have occaſion to Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late hereafter; in the mean time, ſince we have ſuch a Prince, and ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, we muſt needs want the ordinary cauſe of Diſtruſt and Diviſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt ſeek higher to find out the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal <pb n="20" facs="tcp:107138:14"/>of this turbulent poſture we are in.</p>

                  <p>Gentlemen, then I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay you no longer: The <hi>Evil Counſellors,</hi> the <hi>Penſioner-Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pac'd Judges,</hi> the <hi>Flattering Divines,</hi> the <hi>Buiſie</hi> and
<hi>Deſigning Papiſts,</hi> the <hi>French Counſels,</hi> are not the
<hi>Cauſes</hi> of our <hi>Misfortunes,</hi> they are but the
<hi>Effects</hi> (as our preſent Diſtractions are) of one <hi>Primary Cauſe;</hi> which is <hi>the Breach and Ruin of our Government;</hi> which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been decaying for near two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, is in our Age brought ſo near to Expiration, that it lyes agoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and can no longer perform the Functions of a <hi>Political</hi> Life, nor carry on the work of Ordering and Preſerving Mankind: So that the Shifts that our <hi>Courtiers</hi> have within ſome years uſed, are but ſo many Tricks, or Concluſions which they are trying to hold Life and Soul together a while longer; and have
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:107138:14"/>played Handy-Dandy with <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and eſpecially with the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> (the only part which is now left entire of the old Conſtitution) by <hi>Adjourning,</hi> and
<hi>Proroguing,</hi> and <hi>Diſſolving</hi> them (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the true meaning of the <hi>Law</hi>) as well in the Reign of our <hi>late King,</hi> as during his <hi>Majeſties</hi> that <hi>now is.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed our
<hi>Counſellors</hi> (perceiving the decay of the <hi>Foundation,</hi> as they muſt, if they can ſee but one Inch into the <hi>Politicks</hi>) ought to have Addreſt themſelves to the <hi>King</hi> to call a
<hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the true Phyſician, and to lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Diſtemper there, and ſo have endeavour'd a Cure, before it had been too late, as I fear it now is: I mean the piecing and patching up the Old Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is true, as the Divine <hi>Machia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> ſays, That Diſeaſes in Government are like a <hi>Maraſmus</hi> in the Body Natural, which is very hard to be diſcovered whilſt it is Curable; and after it comes to be eaſie to diſcern, difficult if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be Remedy'd; yet it is to be ſuppoſed that the <hi>Counſellors</hi> are, or ought to be skilful Phyſicians, and to foreſee the Seeds of State-Diſtempers,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107138:15"/>time enough to prevent the Death of the Patient; elſe they ought in Conſcience to excuſe themſelves from that ſublime Employment, and betake themſelves to Callings more ſuitable to their Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. So that although for this Reaſon the <hi>Miniſters of State</hi> here are inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and deſerve all the Fury which muſt one time or other be let looſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, (except they ſhall ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fly from the wrath to come, by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out in time, and adviſing the true means of ſetting themſelves to rights) yet neither <hi>Prince</hi> nor
<hi>People</hi> are in the mean time to be blamed for not being able to Conduct things better. No more than the Waggoner is to anſwer for his ill guiding, or the Oxon for their ill draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Waggon, when it is with Age and ill uſage broken, and the Wheels unſerviceable: Or the Pilot and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, for not weathring out a Storm, when the Ship hath ſprung a planck. And as in the body of Man, ſometimes the Head and all the Members are in good Order, nay, the Vital Parts are ſound and entire; yet if there be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Putrifaction in the humors, <pb n="23" facs="tcp:107138:15"/>much more, if the Blood (which the Scripture calls the life) be Impure and Corrupted; the Patient ceaſes not to be in great Danger, and oftentimes dies without ſome skillful Phyſician: And in the mean time the Head and all the parts ſuffer, and are unquiet, full as much, as if they were all immediately affected. So it is in every reſpect with the Body Politick, or Commonwealth, when their Foundations are moulder'd: And although in both theſe Caſes, the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents cannot (though the Diſtemper be in their own Bodies) know what they ail, but are forced to ſend for ſome Artiſt to tell them; yet they ceaſe not to be extreamly uneaſie and impatient, and lay hold of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes upon unſuitable Remedies, and impute their Malady to wrong and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Cauſes. As ſome people do here, who think that <hi>the growth of Popery</hi> is our only Evil, and that if we were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure againſt that, our Peace and Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were obtain'd, and that our Diſeaſe needed no other Cure. But of this more when we come to the Cure.</p>

                  <p>Sir, in the Courſe of my Reaſoning upon this Point, I ſhall have occaſion to inſiſt and expatiate upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, which both my ſelf and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have Publiſh'd in former times. For which I will only make this excuſe, that the Repetition of ſuch matters is the more pardonable, becauſe they will be at leaſt new to you, who are a ſtranger to our Affairs and Writings. And the rather becauſe thoſe diſcourſes ſhall be apply'd to our preſent condition, and ſuited to our preſent occaſions. But I will ſay no more, but obey you, and proceed. I will not take <pb n="27" facs="tcp:107138:17"/>upon me to ſay, or ſo much as Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, how and when Government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the World, or what Government is moſt Ancient: Hiſtory muſt needs be ſilent in that point, for that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is more Ancient than Hiſtory. And there was never any Writer, but was bred under ſome Government, which is neceſſarily ſuppoſed to be the Parent of all Arts and Sciences, and to have produced them. And therefore it would be as hard for a man to Write an account of the beginning of the Laws and Polity of any Countrey, except there were memory of it, (which cannot be before the firſt Hiſtoriographer) as it would be to any perſon without Records to tell the particular Hiſtory of his own Birth.</p>

                  <p>I never ſaid that we had not ſufficient knowledge of the Original of particular Governments; but it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that theſe great Legiſlators had ſeen, and lived under other Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and had the help of Learned Law-givers and Philoſophers, excepting the firſt who had the Aid of God himſelf. So that it remains undiſcovered yet, how the firſt REgulation of man-kind began: And therefore I will take for granted that which all the Politicians conclude: Which is, That Neceſſity made the firſt Government. For every man by the firſt Law of Nature (which is common to us and brutes) had, like Beaſts in a Paſture, right to every thing, and there being no Property, each Individual, if he were the ſtronger, might ſeize what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any other had poſſeſſed himſelf of before, which made a State of perpetual War. To Remedy which, and the fear that nothing ſhould be long enjoyed by any particular perſon (neither was any mans Life in ſafety) every man conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be debar'd of that Univerſal Right to all things, and confine himſelf to a qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and ſecure enjoyment of ſuch a part as <pb n="30" facs="tcp:107138:19"/>ſhould be allotted him: Thence came in Ownerſhip, or Property; to maintain which it was neceſſary to conſent to Laws, and a Government to put them in Execution. Which of the Governments now extant, or that have been formerly, was firſt, is not poſſible now to be known; but I think this muſt be taken for granted, that whatſoever the Frame or Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was firſt, it was made by the Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Meditation of ſome Wiſe and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Perſon, and conſented to by the whole Number. And then, that it was inſtituted for the good and Preſervation of the Governed, and not for the Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and greatneſs of the Perſon or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons appointed to Govern: The Reaſon why I beg this Conceſſion is, That it ſeems very improbable, not to ſay impoſſible, that a vaſt number of people ſhould ever be brought to conſent to put themſelves under the Power of others, but for the ends aboveſaid, and ſo loſe their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without advantaging themſelves in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing. And it is full as impoſſible that any perſon (or perſons ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in number as Magiſtrates and Rulers are) ſhould by force get an Empire <pb n="31" facs="tcp:107138:19"/>to themſelves. Though I am not ignorant that a whole people have in imminent Dangers, either from the Invaſion of a powerful Enemy, or from Civil Diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, put themſelves wholly into the hands of one Illuſtrious Perſon for a time, and that with good Succeſs, under the beſt Forms of Government: But this is nothing to the Original of States.</p>

                  <p>Really I did not think it worth the taking notice of, for though it be not eaſie to prove a Negative, yet I believe if we could trace all Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Polities that now are, or ever came to our knowledge ſince the World began; we ſhall find none of them to have deſcended from Paternal Power; we know nothing of <hi>Adam's</hi> leaving the Empire to
<hi>Cain,</hi> or <hi>Seth:</hi> It was impoſſible for <hi>Noah</hi> to retain any Juriſdiction over his own three Sons; who were diſperſed into three parts of the World, if our Antiquaries Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late right; and as for
<hi>Abraham,</hi> whilſt <pb n="32" facs="tcp:107138:20"/>he lived, as alſo his Son
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> they were but ordinary Fathers of Families, and no queſtion governed their own Houſhold as all others do; but when <hi>Jacob</hi> upon his Death-bed did relate to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the Promiſe Almighty God had made his Grandfather, to make him a great Nation, and give his Poſterity a fruitful Territory, he ſpeaks not one word of the Empire of <hi>Reuben</hi> his firſt-born, but ſuppoſes them all equal: And ſo they were taken to be by <hi>Moſes,</hi> when he divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Land to them by Lot; and by Gods command made them a <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> So that I believe this fancy to have been firſt ſtarted, not by the ſolid Judgement of any man, but to flatter ſome Prince, and to aſſert, for want of better Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the <hi>jus Divinum</hi> of Monarchy.</p>

                  <p>I have been impertinent in interrupting you, but yet now I cannot repent of it, ſince your Anſwer hath given me ſo much ſatisfaction; but if it be ſo as you ſay, that Government was at firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for the Intereſt and Preſervation of Mankind, how comes it to paſs, That there are and have been ſo many abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Monarchies in the World, in which <pb n="33" facs="tcp:107138:20"/>it ſeems that nothing is provided for, but the Greatneſs and Power of the Prince.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eng. Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>I have preſumed to give you already my Reaſon, why I take for granted, that ſuch a Power could never be given by the Conſent of any People, for a perpetuity; for though the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did againſt the will of <hi>Samuel,</hi> and indeed of God himſelf demand, and afterwards chuſe themſelves a King; yet he was never ſuch a King as we ſpeak of; for that all the Orders of their Commonwealth the Sanhedrim, the Congregation of the People, the Princes of the Tribes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> did ſtill remain in being, as hath been excellently proved by a learned Gentleman of our Nation, to whom I refer you; it may then be enquired into, how theſe Monarchies at firſt did ariſe. Hiſtory being in this point ſilent, as to the Ancient Principalities, we will Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that ſome of them might very well proceed from the Corruption of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Governments, which muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſe a Depravation in manners (as nothing is more certain than that Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick defects breed Moral ones, as our Nation is a pregnant Example) this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery <pb n="34" facs="tcp:107138:21"/>of manners might blind the underſtandings of a great many, deſtroy the Fortunes of others, and make them indigent, infuſe into very many a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and careleſneſs of the publick good (which in all ſetled States is very much regarded) ſo that it might eaſily come into the Ambition of ſome bold aſpiring Perſon to affect Empire, and as eaſily into his Power, by fair pretences with ſome, and promiſes of advantages with others, to procure Followers, and gain a numerous Party, either to Uſurp Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny over his own Countrey, or to lead men forth to Conquer and Subdue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus it is ſuppoſed that
<hi>Nimrod</hi> got his Kingdom; who in Scripture is called a Great Hunter before God, which Expoſiters interpret, A great Tyrant. The Modern Deſpotical Powers have been acquired by one of theſe two ways, either by pretending by the firſt Founder thereof, that he had a Divine Miſſion and ſo gaining not only Followers, but even eaſie Acceſs in ſome places without Force to Empire, and aftewards dilate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Power by great Conqueſts. Thus <hi>Mahomet</hi> and <hi>Cingis Can</hi> began, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:107138:21"/>eſtabliſhed the <hi>Sarazen</hi> and <hi>Tartarian</hi> Kingdoms; or by a long Series of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in a Prince, or chief Magiſtrate of a mixt Monarchy, and his Council, who by reaſon of the Sleepineſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency of the People, have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to extinguiſh the great Nobility, or render them Inconſiderable; and ſo by degrees taking away from the People their Protectors, render them Slaves. So the Monarchies of
<hi>France,</hi> and ſome other Countries, have grown to what they are at this day; there being left but a Shadow of the three States in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe Mocarchies, and ſo no bounds remaining to the Regal Power; but ſince Property remains ſtill to the Subjects, theſe Governments may be ſaid to be changed, but not founded or eſtabliſhed; for there is no Maxim more Infallible and Holding in any Science, than this is in the Politicks, <hi>That Empire is founded in Property.</hi> Force or Fraud may alter a Government; but it is Property that muſt Found and Eterniſe it: Upon this undeniable
<hi>Aphoriſme</hi> we are to build moſt of our ſubſequent Reaſoning, in the mean time we may ſuppoſe, that <pb n="36" facs="tcp:107138:22"/>hereafter the great power of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> may diminiſh much, when his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and oppreſſed Subjects come to be commanded by a Prince of leſs Courage, Wiſdom, and Military Vertue, when it will be very hard for any ſuch King to Govern Tyrannically a Country which is not entirely his own.</p>

                  <p>You will underſtand that, Doctor, before I have finiſht this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; but to ſtay your Stomach till then, you may pleaſe to know that in <hi>France</hi> the greatneſs of the Nobility which has been lately taken from them, did not conſiſt in vaſt Riches and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, but in great Priviledges, and Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which obliged the People to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them; whereas our great Peers in former times had not only the ſame great Dependences, but very Conſiderable Revenues beſides, in Demeſnes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: <pb n="37" facs="tcp:107138:22"/>This Vaſſallage over the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which the Peers of <hi>France</hi> had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aboliſht, the Power over thoſe Tenants, which before was in their Lords, fell naturally and of courſe into the Crown, although the Lands and poſſeſſions diveſted of thoſe Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences did and do ſtill remain to the Owners; whereas here in
<hi>England,</hi> though the Services are for the moſt part worn out, and inſignificant; yet for want of Providence and Policy in former Kings, who could not foreſee the danger a far off, Entails have been ſuffered to be cut off; and ſo two parts in ten of all thoſe vaſt Eſtates, as well Mannours as Demeſnes, by the Luxury and Folly of the Owners, have been within theſe two hundred years pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by the leſſer Gentry and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; which has been ſo far from advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taging the Crown, that it has made the Country ſcarce governable by Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy: But if you pleaſe, I will go on with my diſcourſe about Government, and come to this again hereafter?</p>

                  <p>I cannot find by the ſmall <pb n="38" facs="tcp:107138:23"/>reading I have, that there were any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Governments in the World Ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than theſe three, <hi>Monarchy, Ariſtocracy,</hi> and <hi>Democracy.</hi> For the firſt, I have no light out of Antiquity to convince me, that there were in old times any other <hi>Monarchies,</hi> but ſuch as were abſolutely
<hi>Deſpotical;</hi> all Kingdoms then, as well in <hi>Greece</hi> (as
<hi>Macedon, Epirus,</hi> and the like; and where it is ſaid, the Princes exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Power moderately) as in <hi>Aſia,</hi> being altogether unlimited by any Laws, or any Aſſemblies of Nobility or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Yet I muſt confeſs, <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> when he reckons up the Corruptions of theſe three Governments, calls Tyranny the Corruption of Monarchy; which if he means a Change of Government, (as it is in the Corruptions of the other two) then it muſt follow, that the Philoſopher knew of ſome other Monarchy at the firſt, which afterwards degenerated into Tyranny, that is, into Arbitrary Power; for ſo the Word Tyranny is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken, though in modern Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages it ſignifies the ill Exerciſe of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for certainly Arbitrary Government cannot be called Tyranny, where the <pb n="39" facs="tcp:107138:23"/>whole Property is in the Prince (as we reaſonably ſuppoſe it to have been in thoſe Monarchies) no more than it is Tyranny for you to govern your own Houſe and Eſtate as you pleaſe: But it is poſſible
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle</hi> might not in this ſpeak ſo accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Terms of Art, but might mean, that the ill Government of a Kingdom or Family is Tyranny. However we have one Example, that puzzles Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and that is
<hi>Egypt,</hi> where <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is called King; and yet we ſee, that till <hi>Joſeph's</hi> time he had not the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; for the Wiſdom of that Patriarch taught his Maſter a way to make a new uſe of that Famine, by telling him, that if they would buy their Lives, and ſell their Eſtates (as they did afterwards, and preſerve themſelves by the Kings Bread) they ſhall ſerve <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> which ſhews that <hi>Joſeph</hi> knew well, that <hi>Empire was founded in Property:</hi> But moſt of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Writers in Polity, are of Opinion, that <hi>Egypt</hi> was not a Monarchy till then, though the Prince might have the Title of King, as the
<hi>Heraclides</hi> had in <hi>Sparta,</hi> and <hi>Romulus</hi> and the other Kings had in <hi>Rome;</hi> both which <hi>States</hi> were Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107138:24"/>
                     <hi>Common-Wealths.</hi> They give good Conjectures for this their Opinion, too many to be here mentioned; only one is, That Originally (as they go about to prove) all Arts and Sciences had their Riſe in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> which they think very improbable to have been under a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy. But this Poſition, That all Kings in former times were abſolute, is not ſo Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the intent I have in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which is to prove, That in all States, of what kind ſoever, this Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſme takes place: <hi>Imperium fundatur in Dominio.</hi> So that if there were mixed Monarchies, then the King had not all the Property; but thoſe who ſhared with him in the Adminiſtration of the Soveraignty, had their part, whether it were the Senate, the People, or both; or if he had no Companions in the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power, he had no Sharers like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the Dominion or Poſſeſſion of the Land. For that is all we mean by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, in all this Diſcourſe; for as for Perſonal Eſtate, the Subjects may enjoy it in the largeſt Proportion, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to invade the Empire: The Prince may when he pleaſes take away <pb n="41" facs="tcp:107138:24"/>their Goods, by his Tenants and Vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals (without an Army) which are his Ordinary Force, and anſwers to our <hi>Poſſe Comitatus.</hi> But the Subjects with their Money cannot invade his Crown. So that all the Deſcription we need make of this Kind or Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is, That the whole poſſeſſion of the Country, and the whole power lies in the Hands and Breaſt of one man; he can make Laws, break and repeal them when he pleaſes, or diſpenſe with them in the mean time when he thinks fit; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe in all Judicatories, in behalf of his <hi>Favourites,</hi> take away any particular mans perſonal Eſtate, and his Life too, without the formality of a Criminal Proceſs, or Trial; ſend a Dagger, or a Halter to his chief Miniſters, and command them to make themſelves away; and in fine, do all that his Will or his Intereſt ſuggeſts to him.</p>

<hi>Rome</hi> was much more full of Vertuous and Heroick Citizens, than ever it was under <hi>Aurelius</hi> or <hi>Antonius:</hi> For the Moderns that are of that Judgement, they are moſt of them Divines, not Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians, and ſomething may be ſaid in their behalf, when by their good Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they can infuſe into their imaginary Prince (who ſeems already to have an Image of the Power of God) the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Wiſdom, and Goodneſs too of the Deity.</p>

                  <p>You have very good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to haſten me to that; for indeed, all that has been ſaid yet, is but as it were <pb n="44" facs="tcp:107138:26"/>a Preliminary diſcourſe to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Government of
<hi>England,</hi> and its decay: when it comes to the Cure, I hope you will both help me, for both your ſelf and the Doctor are a thouſand times better than I at Remedies. But I ſhall diſpatch the other two Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
<hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> or <hi>Optimacy,</hi> is a Commonwealth, where the better ſort, that is, the Eminent and Rich men, have the chief Adminiſtration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I ſay, the chief, becauſe there are very few ancient <hi>Optimacies,</hi> but the People had ſome ſhare, as in
<hi>Sparta,</hi> where they had power to Vote, but not Debate; for ſo the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> brought by <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> from <hi>Delphos,</hi> ſettles it; But the truth is, theſe people were the natural
<hi>Spartans.</hi> For <hi>Lycurgus</hi> divided the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try or Territory of
<hi>Laconia</hi> into 39000 Shares; whereof Nine thouſand only of theſe Owners were Inhabitants of <hi>Sparta;</hi> the reſt lived in the Country: ſo that although <hi>Thucidides</hi> call it an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtocracy, and ſo I follow him, yet it was none of thoſe Ariſtocracies uſually deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the Politicians, where the Lands of the Territory were in a great deal fewer
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107138:26"/>Hands. But call it what you will, where ever there was an Ariſtocracy, there the Property, or very much the Over-bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of it, was in the hands of the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoi,</hi> or Governours, be they more or fewer; for if the People have the greateſt intereſt in the Property, they will, and muſt have it in the Empire: A notable example of it is <hi>Rome,</hi> the beſt and moſt glorious Government that ever the Sun ſaw; where the Lands being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually divided amongſt the Tribes, that is the People; it was impoſſible for the <hi>Patricii</hi> to keek them quiet, till they yielded to their deſires, not only to have their <hi>Tribunes,</hi> to ſee that nothing paſſed into a Law without their conſent, but alſo to have it declared, that both the <hi>Conſuls</hi> ſhould not only be choſen by the people (as they ever were, and the Kings too before them) but that they might be elected too, when the people pleaſed, out of <hi>Plebeian</hi> Families. So that now I am come to <hi>Democracy.</hi> Which you ſee is a Government where the chief part of the Soveraign Power, and the exerciſe of it, reſides in the <hi>People;</hi> and where the Style is, <hi>Jeſſu populi au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate <pb n="46" facs="tcp:107138:27"/>patrum.</hi> And it doth conſiſt of three fundamental Orders. The Senate propoſing, the People reſolving, and the Magiſtrates executing. This Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is much more Powerful than an
<hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> becauſe the latter cannot arm the People, for fear they ſhould ſeize upon the Government, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are fain to make uſe of none but Strangers and Mercinaries for Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; which, as the Divine <hi>Machiavil</hi> ſays, has hindred your Commonwealth of
<hi>Venice</hi> from mounting up to Heaven, whither thoſe incomparable Orders, and that venerable Wiſdom uſed by your Citizens in keeping to them, would have carried you, if in all your Wars you had not been ill ſerved.</p>

                  <p>Well, Sir, pray let me ask you one thing concerning
<hi>Venice:</hi> How do you make out your <hi>Imperium fundatur in dominio</hi> there? Have the Gentlemen there, who are the Party governing, the poſſeſſion of the whole Territory? Does not property remain entire to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and other Inhabitants in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Countries of <hi>Padua, Breſcia, Vicenza, Verona, Bergamo, Creman, Treviſi,</hi> and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:107138:27"/>
                     <hi>Friuli,</hi> as alſo in the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltramarine</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and <hi>Iſlands?</hi> And yet I believe you will not deny, but that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Venice</hi> is as well founded, and hath been of as long continuance as any that now is, or ever was in the World.</p>

                  <p>Doctor, I ſhall not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer you in this, becauſe I am ſure it will be better done by this Gentleman, who is a worthy Son of that honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Mother.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Noble Ven.</speaker>
                  <p>I thought you had ſaid, Sir, that we ſhould have done Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting; but ſince you do Command me to clear the Objection made by our learned Doctor, I ſhall preſume to tell you, firſt how our City began. The <hi>Goths, Huns,</hi> and <hi>Lombards</hi> coming with all the Violence and Cruelty im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable, to invade that part of <hi>Italy</hi> which we now call <hi>Terra firma,</hi> and where our Anceſtors did then inhabit, forced them in great numbers to ſeek a ſhelter amongſt a great many little Rocks, or <hi>Iſlands,</hi> which ſtood very thick in a vaſt Lake, or rather Marſh, which is made by the <hi>Adriatique</hi> Sea, we call it
<hi>Laguna;</hi> here they began to build, and getting <pb n="48" facs="tcp:107138:28"/>Boats, made themſelves Proviſions of all kind from the Land; from whence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable people began to come to them, finding that they could ſubſiſt, and that the barbarous people had no Boats to attack them, nor that they could be invaded either by Horſe or Foot without them. Our firſt Government, and which laſted for many years, was no more than what is practiſed in many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Pariſhes in <hi>Italy,</hi> and poſſibly here too, where the Clerk, or any other perſon, calls together the chief of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to conſider of Pariſh-buſineſs, as chuſing of Officers, making of Rates, and the like. So in <hi>Venice,</hi> when there was any publick proviſion to be made by way of law, or otherwiſe, ſome Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers went about to perſons of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Wealth and Credit, to intreat them to meet and conſult; from whence our Senate is called to this day <hi>Conſiglio de pregadi,</hi> which in our Barbarous Idiom is as much as
<hi>Pregati</hi> in <hi>Tuſcan</hi> Language: Our ſecurity increaſed daily, and ſo by conſequence our Number and our Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; for by this time there began to be another inundation of <hi>Sarazens</hi> upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:107138:28"/>Minor, which forced a great many of the poor people of
<hi>Greece</hi> to fly to us for protection, giving us the poſſeſſion of ſome Iſlands, and other places upon the Continent: This opened us a Trade, and gave a beginning to our greatneſs; but chiefly made us conſider what Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was fitteſt to conſerve our ſelves, and keep our Wealth (for we did not then much dream of Conqueſts, elſe without doubt we muſt have made a popular Government) we pitcht upon an <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> by ordering that thoſe who had been called to Council for that preſent year, and for four years before, ſhould have the Government in their hands, and all their Poſterity after them for ever; which made firſt the diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between Gentlemen and Citizens; the People, who conſiſted of divers Nations, moſt of them newly come to inhabit there, and generally ſeeking nothing but ſafety and eaſe, willingly conſented to this change, and ſo this <hi>State</hi> hath continued to this day; though the ſeveral Orders and Counſels have been brought in ſince, by degrees, as our Nobility encreaſed, and for other <pb n="50" facs="tcp:107138:29"/>cauſes. Under this Government we have made ſome Conqueſts in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> for our City ſtood like a Wall between the two great Torrents of <hi>Goths</hi> and
<hi>Sarazens;</hi> and as either of their Empires declin'd, it was eaſie for us, without being very Warlike, to pick up ſome pieces of each ſide; as for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of theſe Conqueſts, we did not think fit to divide the Land amongſt our Nobility, for fear of envy, and the effects of it: much leſs did we think it adviſeable to plant Colonies of our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which would have given the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into their hands, but we thought it the beſt way for our Government to leave the People their Property, tax them what we thought fit, &amp; keep them under by Governours and Citadels, and ſo in ſhort make them a Province. So that now the Doctors Riddle is ſolved; for I ſuppoſe this Gentleman did not mean that his Maxime ſhould reach to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Governments.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eng. Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>No, Sir, ſo far from that, that it is juſt contrary; for as in Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or Domeſtick Government, where a Nation is Governed either by its own <pb n="51" facs="tcp:107138:29"/>People or its own Prince, there can be no ſettled Government, except they have the Rule who poſſeſs the Country. So in Provincial Governments, if they be wiſely ordered, no man muſt have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the leaſt ſhare in the managing Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of State, but ſtrangers, or ſuch as have no ſhare or part in the poſſeſſions there, for elſe they will have a very good opportunity of ſhaking off their Yoak.</p>

                  <p>That is true; and we are ſo wiſe here (I mean our Anceſtors were) as to have made a Law, That no Native in <hi>Ireland</hi> can be <hi>Deputy</hi> there: But, Sir, being fully fatisfied in my demand, by this Centleman; I beſeech you to go on to what you have to ſay, before you come to <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>I ſhall then offer two things to your obſervation; the firſt is, That in all times and places, where any great Heroes or Legiſlators, have founded a Government, by gathering people toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to build a City, or to invade any Countrey to poſſeſs it, before they c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>me to dividing the conquered Lands, they did always very maturely deliberate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <pb n="52" facs="tcp:107138:30"/>what Form or Model of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they meant to live, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made the Partition of the Poſſeſſions; <hi>Moſes, Theſeus,</hi> and <hi>Romulus,</hi> Founders of <hi>Demacracies,</hi> divided the Land equally: <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curgus</hi> who meant an <hi>Optimacy,</hi> made a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of Shares, which he intended to be in the hands of the People of <hi>Laco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia. Cyrus,</hi> and other conquering Monarchs before him, took all for themſelves and Succeſſors, which is obſerved in thoſe Eaſtern Countries to this day, and which has made thoſe Countries continue ever ſince under the ſame Government, though Conquered and poſſeſſed very often by ſeveral Nations: This brings me to the ſecond thing to be obſerved, which is,
<hi>That wherever this apportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Lands came to be changed in any kind, the Government either changed with it, or was wholly in a ſtate of confuſion:</hi> And for this reaſon <hi>Licurgus,</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Politician that ever Founded any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, took a ſure way to fix Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty by Confounding it, and bringing all into Common: And ſo the whole number of the Natural <hi>Spartans,</hi> who inhabited the City of
<hi>Lacedemon,</hi> eat <pb n="53" facs="tcp:107138:30"/>and drank in their ſeveral
<hi>convives</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And as long as they continued ſo to do, they did not only preſerve their Government entire, and that for a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er time than we can read of any Common-Wealth that ever laſted amongſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, but held as it were the principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Greece.</hi> The
<hi>Athenians,</hi> for want of ſome Conſtitutions to fix Property, as
<hi>Theſeus</hi> placed it, were in danger of utter ruine, which they had certainly encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, if the good Genius (as they then call'd it) of that People, had not raiſed them up a ſecond Founder, more than ſix hundred years after the firſt, which was <hi>Solon:</hi> And becauſe the Hiſtory of this matter will very much conduce to the illuſtrating of this Aphoriſme we have laid down, I will preſume ſo much upon your patience as to make a ſhort recital of it, leaving you to ſee it more at large in
<hi>Plutarch</hi> and other Authors. The Lands in the Territory of
<hi>Attica</hi> which were in the poſſeſſion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, (for what reaſon Hiſtory is ſilent) were for Debt all Mortgaged to the great Men of the City of <hi>Athens,</hi> and the Owners having no poſſibility of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming <pb n="54" facs="tcp:107138:31"/>their Eſtates, were treating to Compound with their Creditors, and deliver up their Lands to them:
<hi>Solon</hi> (who was one of thoſe State Phyſicians we ſpake of,) was much troubled at this, and harangued daily to the Nobility and People againſt it, telling them firſt, that it was impoſſible for the <hi>Grecians</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the <hi>Medes</hi> (who were then growing up to a powerful Monarchy) except <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> the ſecond City of <hi>Greece</hi> did conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue a Democracy; That it was as Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the People could keep their Empire, except they kept their Lands, nothing being more contrary to Nature, than that thoſe who poſſeſs nothing in a Country can pretend to Govern it. They were all ſenſible of his Reaſons, and of their own Danger, but the only Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (which was, that the great Men ſhould forgive the Common People their Debts) would not at all be digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that the whole City now fully underſtanding their condition, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in an uproar, and the People flock'd about <hi>Solon,</hi> whenever he came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, deſiring him to take upon him the Government, and be their Prince,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107138:31"/>and they would make choice of him the next time they aſſembled. He told them no, he would never be a Tyrant, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in his own Country; meaning, that he who had no more ſhare than other of the Nobles, could not Govern the reſt, without being an Uſurper or Tyrant: But this he did to oblige his Citizens, he frankly forgave all the Debts that any of the People owed to him, and releaſed their Lands immediately; and this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to fifteen <hi>Attick</hi> Talents of Gold, a vaſt ſum in thoſe days; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf to a voluntary Exile, in which he viſited
<hi>Thales,</hi> and went to the Oracle of <hi>Delphos,</hi> and offer up his Prayers to <hi>Apollo</hi> for the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his City: In return of which (as the People then believed) the hearts of the great ones were ſo changed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, that they readily agreed to remit all their Debts to the People, upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that <hi>Solon</hi> would take the pains to make them a New Model of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Laws ſuitable to a Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which he as readily accepted and performed; by vertue of which that City grew and continued long the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, <pb n="56" facs="tcp:107138:32"/>the Juſteſt, the moſt Vertuous, Learned and Renowed of all that Age; drove the <hi>Perſians</hi> afterwards out of <hi>Greece,</hi> defeated them doth by Sea and Land, with a quarter of their number of Ships and Men; and produced the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Wits and Philoſophers that ever li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon Earth. The City of <hi>Athens</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted a Solemn Feaſt in Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that great Generoſity and Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial of the Nobility; who Sacrificed their own Intereſt to the preſervation of their Country: which Feaſt was called the Solemnity of the
<hi>Seiſactheia,</hi> which ſignifies reciſion or abolition of Debts, and was obſerved with Proceſſions, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and Games, till the time of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Dominion over them (who encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged it,) and ever till the change of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in <hi>Greece,</hi> and Invaſion of the
<hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razens.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi>'s having omitted in their Inſtitution to provide for the fixing of Property, and ſo the Nobility called
<hi>Patricii,</hi> beginning to take to themſelves a greater ſhare in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd Lands than had been uſual (for in the firſt times of the Commonwealth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Romulus,</hi> and ever after, it was always
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:107138:32"/>practiſed to divide the Lands equally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Tribes) this Innovation ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up <hi>Licinius Stolo,</hi> then Tribune of the People, to propoſe a Law; which, although it met with much difficulty, yet at laſt was conſented to; by which it was provided, that no
<hi>Roman</hi> Citizen, of what degree ſoever, ſhould poſſeſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove five hundred Acres of Land; and for the remaining part of the Lands which ſhould be Conquer'd, it was Ordered to be equally divided, as formerly, amongſt the Tribes: This found admittance, after much opoſition, becauſe it did provide but for the future, no Man at that time being owner of more Lands than what was lawful for him to poſſeſs; and if this law had been ſtrictly obſerved to the laſt, that glorious Commonwealth might have ſubſiſted to this day, for ought we know.</p>

                  <p>Oh <hi>Doctor,</hi> if they had kept their Poverty they had kept their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and their Vertue too, and then it had not been an eaſie matter to ſubdue <pb n="58" facs="tcp:107138:33"/>them, <hi>Quos vult perdere Jupiter dementat;</hi> Breach of Rules and Order cauſes Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Diviſion when it comes to be Incurable, expoſes a Nation almoſt as much as a Tyrannical Government does. The <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> had they Invaded in thoſe days, had met with the ſame ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs which befell the <hi>Cymbri,</hi> and the <hi>Teutones.</hi> I muſt confeſs, a Foreign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion is a Formidable thing, when a Commonwealth is weak in Territory and Inhabitants, and that the Invader is numerous and Warlike: And ſo we ſee the <hi>Romans</hi> were in danger of utter ruine when they were firſt attacqued by the <hi>Gauls</hi> under <hi>Brennus:</hi> The like hazzard may be fear'd, when a Commonwealth is aſſaulted by another of equal Vertue, and a Commander of equal Addreſs and Valour to any of themſelves. Thus the
<hi>Romans</hi> run the risk of their Liberty and Empire, in the War of
<hi>Hannibal;</hi> but their Power and their Vertue grew to that heighth in that conteſt, that when it was ended, I believe, that if they had preſerved the Foundation of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment entire, they had been Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible: And if I were alone of this Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <pb n="59" facs="tcp:107138:33"/>I might be aſhamed; but I am backt by the Judgement of your Incomparable Country-man <hi>Machiavil;</hi> and no Man will condemn either of us of raſhneſs, if he firſt conſider, what ſmall States, that have ſtood upon right bottoms, have done to defend their Liberty againſt great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs; as is to be ſeen in the example of the little Commonwealth of <hi>Athens,</hi> which deſtroyed the Fleet of

                  <p>I beſeech you, Sir, how was it poſſible, or practicable, that the <hi>Romans</hi> Conquering ſo many and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Provinces, ſhould yet have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to preſerve their Agrarian Law, and divide all thoſe Lands equally to their Citizens; Or if it had been poſſible, yet it would have ruin'd their City, by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their Inhabitants away; and by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107138:34"/>taking in Strangers in their room, they muſt neceſſarily have had people leſs Vertuous and leſs Warlike, and ſo both their Government and their Military Diſcipline muſt have been Corrupted; for it is not to be imagined, but that the People would have gone with their Families to the place where their Lands lay: So that it appears that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> did not provide, in the making and framing their firſt Polity, for ſo great Conqueſts as they afterwards made.</p>

                  <p>Yes, ſurely they did; from their firſt beginning they were Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. in War, and had neither Land nor Wives but what they fought for; but yet what you object were very weighty, if there had not been a conſideration of that early: For aſſoon as that great and wiſe People had ſubdued the
<hi>Samnites</hi> on the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and brought their Arms as far as the
<hi>Greek</hi> Plantations, in that part of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> which is now called the Kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> and Weſtward, had reduced all the
<hi>Tuſcans</hi> under their Obedience, as far as the River <hi>Arnus,</hi> they made that and the River <hi>Volturnus</hi> (which runs by the Walls of
<hi>Capua</hi>) the two Boundaries of <pb n="61" facs="tcp:107138:34"/>their Empire, which was called <hi>Domici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium Imperii.</hi> Theſe were the <hi>ne plus ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> for what they Conquered between theſe two Rivers, was all confiſcated and divided amongſt the Tribes; the <hi>Ruſtick</hi> Tribes being twenty ſeven, and the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane</hi> Tribes nine, which made thirty ſix in all. The City Tribes were like our Companies in <hi>London,</hi> conſiſting of Tradeſmen. The Country Tribes were divided like Shires, and there was ſcarce any Landed Man, who Inhabited in the City, but he was written in that Tribe where his Eſtate lay; ſo that the <hi>Ruſtick</hi> Tribes (though they had all equal Voices) were of far more Credit and Reputation than the <hi>

Now it was over lawful for any <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe what Lands he pleaſed in any of theſe Provinces; it not being dangerous to a City to have their People rich, but to have ſuch a Power in the Governing part of the Empire, as ſhould make thoſe who managed the Affairs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth depend upon them; which came afterwards to be that which ruined their Liberty, and which the <hi>Gracchi</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prevent when it was too late; For thoſe Illuſtrious perſons ſeeing the diſorder that was then in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and rightly comprehending the Reaſon, which was the intermiſſion of the <hi>Agrarian,</hi> and by conſequence the great Purchaſes which were made by the Men of <hi>Rome</hi> (who had inriched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in <hi>Aſia</hi> and the other Provinces)

<hi>Agrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Law with a Retroſpect; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they carried, yet the difficulties in the Execution proved ſo great, that it never took effect, by reaſon that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, whoſe Intereſt it was to have their Lands reſtored; yet having long lived as Clients, and Dependents of the great ones, choſe rather to depend ſtill upon their Patrons, than to hazard all for an Imaginary deliverance, by which ſupineneſs in them, they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with rather to joyne (for the moſt part) with the Oppreſſors of themſelves and their Countrey, and to cut the throats of their redeemers, than to employ their juſt reſentment againſt the covetous Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators of their Government and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

                  <p>Sir, I approve what you ſay in all things, and in Confirmation of it, ſhall further alledge the two famous Princes of
<hi>Sparta, Agis,</hi> and <hi>Cleomines,</hi> which I couple together, ſince
<hi>Plutarch</hi> does ſo; Theſe finding the Corruption of their Commonwealth, and the Decay of their ancient Vertue, to proceed from the neglect and inobſervance of their Founders Rules, and a breach of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality which was firſt inſtituted; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reſtore the Laws of
<hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and divide the Territory anew; their Victory in the
<hi>Peloponneſian</hi> War, and the Riches and Luxury brought into their City by <hi>Liſander,</hi> having long before <pb n="65" facs="tcp:107138:36"/>broken all the Orders of their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and deſtroyed the Proportions of Land allotted to each of the Natural <hi>Spartans:</hi> But the firſt of theſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Patriots periſhed by Treachery in the beginning of his Enterprize, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther began and went on with incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Prudence and Reſolution, but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried afterwards by the Iniquity of the times, and baſeneſs and wickedneſs of the People; ſo infalliably true it is, That where the Policy is corrupted, there muſt neceſſarily be alſo a corruption and depravation of Manners, and an utter abolition of all Faith, Juſtice, Honour, and Morality; but I forget my ſelf, and intrench upon your Province: there is nothing now remains to keep you from the Modern Policies, but that you pleaſe to ſhut up this Diſcourſe of the Ancient Governments, with ſaying ſomething of the Corruptions of <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> and
<hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy;</hi> for I believe both of us are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that you have abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you Aſſertion, and that when we have leiſure to examine all the States or Policies that ever were, we ſhall find all their Changes to have turn'd upon <pb n="66" facs="tcp:107138:37"/>this Hinge of Property, and that the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that with good lawes in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or firſt Inſtitution of a ſtate, and the holding to thoſe Lawes afterwards, is the only way to make a Commonwealth Immortal.</p>

                  <p>I think you are very right; but I ſhall obey you, and do preſume to differ from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in thinking that he has not fitly called thoſe extreams (for ſo I will ſtile them) of
<hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy,</hi> Corruptions; for that they do not proceed from the alteration of Property, which is the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nica corruptio po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litica:</hi> For Example, I do not find that Oligarchy, or Government of a few, which is the Extream of an Optimacy, ever did ariſe from a few Mens getting into their hands the Eſtates of all the reſt of the Nobility: For had it began ſo, it might have laſted, which I never read of any that did. I will therefore conclude, that they were all Tyrannies; for ſo the
<hi>Greeks</hi> called all Uſurpations, whether of one or more perſons, and all thoſe that I ever read of, as they came in either by Craft or violence, as the Thirty Tyrants of <hi>Athens,</hi> the Fifteen of <hi>Thebes,</hi> and the <pb n="67" facs="tcp:107138:37"/>
                     <hi>Decem-viri</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> (though theſe are firſt came in lawfully) ſo they were ſoon dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out; and ever, were either aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, or dyed by the Sword of Juſtice; and therefore I ſhall ſay no more of them, not thinking them worth the name of a Government. As for the Extream of <hi>Democracy,</hi> which is
<hi>Anarchy,</hi> it is not ſo: for many Commonwealths have laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a good time under that Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration (if I may ſo call a State ſo full of Confuſion.) An <hi>Anarchy</hi> then is, when the People not contented with their Share in the Adminiſtration of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, (which is the right of Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, or Diſapproving of Lawes, of Leagues, and of making of War and Peace, of Judging in all Cauſes upon an Appeal to them, and chuſing all manner of Officers) will take upon themſelves the Office of the
<hi>Senate</hi> too, in manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Subordinate Matters of State, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Lawes Originally, and aſſuming Debate in the Market place, making their Orators their Leaders; nay, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this, will take upon them to alter all the Orders of the Government when they pleaſe; as was frequently
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:107138:38"/>practiſed in <hi>Athens,</hi> and in the Modern State of
<hi>Florence.</hi> In both theſe Cities, when ever any great perſon who could lead the People, had a mind to alter the Government, he call'd them together, and made them Vote a Change. In <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> they call'd it,
<hi>Chiamar il popolo a Parlamento e ripigliar lo Stato,</hi> which is ſummoning the People into the Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place to reſume the Government, and did then preſently Inſtitute a new one, with new Orders, new Magiſtracies, and the like. Now that which originally cauſes this Diſorder, is the admitting (in the beginning of a Government, or afterwards) the meaner ſort of People, who have no Share in the Territory, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an equal part of Ordering the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; theſe being leſs ſober, leſs conſidering, and leſs careful of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Concerns; and being commonly the Major part, are made the Inſtruments oft-times of the Ambition of the great ones, and very apt to kindle into Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but notwithſtaning all the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which we ſee under an Anarchy, (where the wiſdom of the better ſort is made uſeleſs by the fury of the People) <pb n="69" facs="tcp:107138:38"/>yet many Cities have ſubſiſted hundreds of years in this condition; and have been more conſiderable, and performed great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Actions, than ever any Government of equal Extent did, except it were a well-regulated
<hi>Democracy;</hi> But it is true, they ruine in the end, and that never by Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardize or baſeneſs, but by too much boldneſs and temerarious undertakings, as both <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> did; The firſt undertaking the Invaſion of <hi>Sicily,</hi> when their Affairs went ill elſewhere; and the other by provoking the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> and the

As for <hi>Moſes,</hi> we have his Story written by an Infalliable Pen;
<hi>Theſeus</hi> was ever called King of <hi>Athens,</hi> though he liv'd ſo long ſince, that what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him is juſtly eſteem'd fabulous; <pb n="70" facs="tcp:107138:39"/>but <hi>Romulus</hi> certainly was a King, and that Government continued a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, though Elective, under ſeven Princes.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eng. Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>I will be very ſhort in my Anſwer, and ſay nothing of
<hi>Theſeus,</hi> for the reaſon you are pleaſed to alledge: But for
<hi>Moſes,</hi> you may read in Holy Writ, that when, by God's Command, he had brought the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> he did at firſt manage them by accquainting the People with the Eſtate of their Government, which People were called together with the ſound of a Trumpet, and are termed in Scripture, the Congregation of the Lord; this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment he thought might ſerve their turn in their paſſage, and that it would be time enough to make them a better when they were in poſſeſſion of the Land of
<hi>Canaan;</hi> Eſpecially having made them Judges and Magiſtrates at the inſtance of his Father-in-law, which are called in Authors, <hi>Proefecti Jethroniani;</hi> but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this Proviſion was not ſufficient, complained to God of the difficulty he had, to make that State of Affairs hold together; God was pleaſed to order <pb n="71" facs="tcp:107138:39"/>him to let ſeventy Elders be appointed for a Senate, but yet the Congregation of the Lord continued ſtill and acted: And by the ſeverall ſoundings of the Trumpets, either the Senate or popular Aſſembly were called together, or both; ſo that this Government was the ſame with all other <hi>Demooracies,</hi> conſiſting of a Principal Magiſtrate, a Senate, and a People Aſſembled together, not by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſention, but in a body. Now for
<hi>Romulus,</hi> it is very plain, that he was no more then the firſt Officer of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, whatever he was called, and that he was choſen (as your <hi>Doge</hi> is) for Life; and when the laſt of thoſe ſeven Kings uſurpt the place, that is, did reign <hi>injuſſu Populi,</hi> and excerciſe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Tyrannically, the People drove him out (as all People in the World that have Property will do in the like Caſe, except ſome extraordinary qualifications in the Prince preſerve him for one Age) and afterwards appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his room two Magiſtrates, and made them Annual, which two had the ſame Command, as well in their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as in their Cities, and did not make <pb n="72" facs="tcp:107138:40"/>the leaſt alteration beſides, excepting that they choſe an Officer that was to perform the Kings Function in certain Sacrifices (which <hi>Numa</hi> appointed to be performed by the King) leſt the People ſhould think their Religion were chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: This Officer was called <hi>Rex Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus.</hi> If you are ſatisfied, I will go on to the conſideration of our Modern States.</p>

                  <p>I am fully anſwered, and beſides am clearly of Opinion, that no Government, whether mixt Monarchy or Commonwealth, can ſubſiſt without a Senate, as well from the turbulent State of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> under <hi>Moſes</hi> till the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> was inſtituted, as from a certain Kingdom of the <hi>Vandals</hi> in <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;</hi> where after their Conqueſt of the Natives, they appointed a Government conſiſting of a Prince and a Popular Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, which latter, within half a year, beat the Kings brains out, he having no bulwark of Nobility or Senate to defend him from them.

                  <p>Sir, you are very right, and we ſhould have ſpoken ſomething of that before, if it had been the buſineſs of this Meeting to Diſcourſe of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Models of Government; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending only to ſay ſo much of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Policy as to ſhew what Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in General is, and upon what Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis it ſtands, I think I have done it ſufficiently to make way for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of our own, at leaſt when I have ſaid ſomething of the Policies which are now extant; and that with your favour I will do. I ſhall need ſay little now of thoſe Commonwealths, which however they came by their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, either by Arms or Purchaſe, are now much-what under the ſame kind of Policy as the Ancients were. In
<hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> the Free Towns, and many Princes make up the Body of a Commonwealth called the Empire, of which the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is Head; this General Union hath its Diets or Parliaments, where they are all repreſented, and where all things concerning the Safety and Intereſt of <hi>Germany</hi> in General, or that belong to Peace and War, are Tranſacted; theſe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107138:41"/>Diets never intermeddle with the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Concerns or Policies of thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or States that make it up, leaving to them their particular Soveraignties: The ſeveral Imperial Cities, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, are divided into two kinds, <hi>Lubeck's</hi> Law, and <hi>Collen's</hi> Law, which being the ſame exactly with the ancient <hi>Democracies</hi> and
<hi>Optimacies,</hi> I will ſay no more of them. The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of
<hi>Swizerland,</hi> and the Seven Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> were made up in haſte, to Unite them againſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution and Oppreſſion, and to help to defend themſelves the better, which they both have done very gallantly and ſucceſsfully: They ſeem to have taken their Pattern from the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who when their Greatneſs began to decline, and the ſeveral Tyrants who ſucceeded <hi>Alexander</hi> began to preſs hard upon them, were forced to League themſelves (yet in ſeverall Confederacies, as that of the <hi>Etolians,</hi> that of the <hi>Achaians, &amp;c.</hi>) for their mutual defence. The <hi>Swiſſes</hi> conſiſt of Thirteen Soveraignties; ſome Cities which are moſt
<hi>Ariſtocraticall,</hi> and ſome Provinces which have but a Village
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107138:41"/>for their head Townſhip. Theſe are all
<hi>Democracies,</hi> and are Govern'd all by the Owners of Land, who Aſſemble as our Free-Holders do at the County-Court. Theſe have their General Diets, as in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> The Government of the United Provinces has for its Foundation the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> made in the beginning of their ſtanding upon their Guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Cruelty and Oppreſſion of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and patcht up in haſte; and ſeeming to be compos'd only for neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as a ſtate of War, has made Modern Stateſmen Conjecture that it will not be very practicable in time of Peace, and Security. At their General Diet, which is called the States General, do inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene the Deputies of the Seven Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in what number their Principals pleaſe; but all of them have but one Vote, which are by conſequence Seven, and every one of the Seven hath a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; ſo that nothing can paſs without the Concurrence of the whole Seven. Every one of theſe Provinces have a Counſel or Aſſembly of their own, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the States Provincial, who ſend and Inſtruct their Deputies to the States-General, <pb n="76" facs="tcp:107138:42"/>and perform other Offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Peace and Quiet of the Province. Theſe Deputies to the States Provincial, are ſent by ſeveral Cities of which every Province conſiſts, and by the Nobility of the Province, which hath one Voice only: The Baſis of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment lies in theſe Cities, which are every of them a diſtinct Soveraignty; neither can the States of the Province, much leſs the States General, intrench in the leaſt upon their Rights, nor ſo much as intermeddle with the Government of their Cities, or Adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but only treat of what concerns their mutual Defence, and their Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments towards it. Every one of theſe Cities is a Soveraignty, governed by an <hi>Optimacy,</hi> conſiſting of the chief Citizens, which upon death are ſupplyed by new ones Elected by themſelves; theſe are called the
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rnuſcaperie</hi> or <hi>Herne,</hi> which Council has continued to Govern thoſe Towns, time out of mind; even in the times of their Princes, who were then the Soveraigns; for without the conſent of him, or his Deputy, called State-Holder, nothing could be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <pb n="77" facs="tcp:107138:42"/>in thoſe days. Since they have Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted an artificial Miniſter of their own, whom they ſtill call State-Holder, and make choice of him in their Provincial Aſſemblies, and for Form ſake defer ſomething to him, as the Approbation of their Skepen and other Magiſtrates, and ſome other Matters: This has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Province of <hi>Holland,</hi> which is the chief Province in the Succeſſion of the Princes of <hi>Orange,</hi> and in the moſt of the others too: The reſt have likewiſe choſen ſome other of the Houſe of <hi>Naſſaw.</hi> This Government (ſo oddly ſet together, and ſo compos'd of a State, intended for a Monarchy, and which, as Almanacks Calculated for one Meridian, are made in ſome ſort to ſerve for another, is by them continued in theſe ſeveral <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracies</hi>) may laſt for a time, till Peace and Security, together with the abuſe which is like to happen in the choice of the <hi>Herne,</hi> when they ſhall Elect perſons of ſmall note into their Body, upon Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancies, for Kindred or Relation, rather than ſuch as are of Eſtate and eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or that otherwiſe abuſe their power in the execution of it, and then it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, <pb n="78" facs="tcp:107138:43"/>and reaſonably enough, that thoſe People (great in wealth, and very acute in the knowledge of their own Intereſt) will find out a better Form of Government, or make themſelves a prey to ſome great Neighbour-Prince in the attempting it; and this in caſe they in the mean time eſcape Conqueſt from this great and powerfull King of
<hi>France,</hi> who at this time gives Law to Chriſtendom. I have nothing now left to keep me from the Modern Monarchies, but the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> of which it would be preſumption for me to ſay any thing whilſt you are preſent.</p>

                  <p>You may very ſafely go one if you pleaſe; for I believe Strangers underſtand the Speculative part of our Government, better than we do; and the Doctrine of the Ballat which is our chiefe excellency: For I have read many Deſcriptions of our Frame, which have taught me ſomething in it which I knew not before; particularly, <hi>Donato Gianotti</hi> the
<hi>Florentine,</hi> to whom I refer thoſe who are curious to know more of our Orders, for we that manage the Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical part of the Government are like
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107138:43"/>Horſes who know their Track well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, without conſidering <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt,</hi> or what buſineſs they go about. Beſides, it would be very tedious, and very needleſs, to make any Relation of our Model, with the ſeveral Counſels that make it up, and would be that which you have not done in Treating of any other Government: what we have ſaid is enough to ſhew what beginning we had, and that ſerves your turn, for we who are called Nobility, and who man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age the State, are the Deſcendents of the firſt Inhabitants, and had therefore been a
<hi>Democracy,</hi> if a numerous Flock of Strangers (who are contented to come and live amongſt us as Subjects) had not ſwelled our City, and made the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party ſeem but a handfull; ſo that we have the ſame foundations that all other <hi>Ariſtocracies</hi> have, who govern but one City, and have no Territory but what they Govern Provincially; and our People not knowing where to have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Juſtice, are very well contented to live amongſt us, without any ſhare in the Managing of Affairs; yet we have power to Adopt whom we pleaſe into <pb n="80" facs="tcp:107138:44"/>our Nobility, and I believe that in the time of the <hi>Roman</hi> greatneſs, there were five for one of the Inhabitants who were written in no Tribe, but look'd upon as Strangers, and yet that did not vitiate their <hi>Democracy,</hi> no more than our Citizens and Common People can hurt our <hi>Optimacy;</hi> all the difficulty in our Adminiſtration, hath been to regulate our own Nobility, and to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle their faction and ambition, which can alone brced a Diſeaſe in the Vital part of our Government, and this we do by moſt ſevere Laws, and a very rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous execution of them.</p>

<hi>Italy,</hi> could not be deterr'd <pb n="81" facs="tcp:107138:44"/>from thoſe execrable and treacherous Murders which were every day commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but by a ſevere Execution of the Laws as well againſt their Lives as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates: And as many of their Eſtates as were Confiſcated, were (during our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities in the laſt War with the <hi>Turks</hi>) expoſed to ſale, and ſold to them that offered moſt, without any conſideration of the perſons purchaſing; But it is very true that moſt of them came into the hands of our Nobility, they offering more than any other, by reaſon that their ſober and frugal living, and their being forbidden all manner of Traffick, makes them have no way of employing the Money which proceeds from their Parſimony, and ſo they can afford to give more than others who may employ their Advance to better profit elſewhere.

                  <p>That is all I have now to do: Thoſe Monarchies are two, Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, and Mixt; for the firſt kind, all that we have knowledge of, except the Empire of the <hi>Turks,</hi> differ ſo little from the ancient Monarchies of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> that having given a ſhort Deſcription of them before, it will be needleſs to ſay any more of the <hi>Perſian,</hi> the <hi>Mogull,</hi> the King of <hi>Pegu, China, Preſtor-John,</hi> or any other the great Men under thoſe Princes, as the <hi>Satrapes</hi> of old; being made ſo only by their being
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107138:45"/>employed and put into great places and Governments by the Soveraign; But the Monarchy of the Grand Seignior is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing different; they both agree in this, that the Prince is in both abſolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor of all the Lands, (excepting in the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt,</hi> of which I ſhall ſay ſomthing anon) but the diverſity lies in the Adminſtration of the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the other Emperours as well Ancient as Modern uſing to manage the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of the ſeveral Towns, and Pariſhes, as our Kings, or the Kings of
<hi>France</hi> do; that is, keep it in their hands, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter it by Officers: And ſo you may read that <hi>Xerxes</hi> King of <hi>Perſia</hi> allowed the Revenue of ſo many Villages to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles,</hi> which Aſſignations are practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at this day, both to publick and to private uſes, by the preſent Monarchs. But the <hi>Turks,</hi> when they invaded the broken Empire of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> did not at firſt make any great alteration in their Policy, till the Houſe of <hi>Ottoman</hi> the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Royal Family did make great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and afterwards in
<hi>Greece;</hi> whence they might poſſibly take their preſent way of dividing their conquered <pb n="84" facs="tcp:107138:46"/>Territories; for they took the ſame courſe which the <hi>Goths</hi> and other Modern People had uſed with their Conquered Lands in <hi>Europe,</hi> upon which they plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Military Colonies, by dividing them amongſt the Souldiers for their pay or maintenance. Theſe Shares were called by them <hi>Timarr's,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> but differ'd in this only from the
<hi>European</hi> Knights-Fees, that theſe laſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally were Hereditary, and ſo Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty was maintained, whereas amongſt the
<hi>Ottomans,</hi> they were meerly at will; and they enjoyed their ſhares whilſt they remained the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Souldiers, and no longer; being turn'd out both of his Service, and of their <hi>Timarr's,</hi> when he pleaſes. This doubtleſs had been the beſt and firmeſt Monarchy in the World, if they could have ſtayed here, and not had a Mercinary Army beſides, which have often (like the Praetorians in the time of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Tyrants) made the Palace and the Serraglio the Shambles of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; whereas if the <hi>Timariots,</hi> aſwell <hi>Spahis</hi> or Horſe, as Foot, had been brought together to Guard the Prince by Courſes (as they uſed to do King <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>) <pb n="85" facs="tcp:107138:46"/>as well as they are to fight for the Empire; this horrid flaw and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience in their Government had been wholly avoided. For though theſe are not planted upon entire Property as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s were, (thoſe being in the nature of Trained-Bands) yet the remoteneſs of their Habitations from the Court, and the Factions of the great City, and their deſire to repair home, and to find all things quiet at their return, would have eaſily kept them from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with that curſed Diſeaſe of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt their Soveraign, upon whoſe favour they depend for the continuance of their livelihood: Whereas the <hi>Janiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> are for life, and are ſure to be in the ſame Employment under the next Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor; ſo ſure, that no Grand Seignior can, or dares go about to Disband them, the ſuſpicion of intending ſuch a thing having cauſed the death of more than one of their Emperours. But I ſhall go to the limited Monarchies.</p>

                  <p>But pray, before you do ſo, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us ſomething of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours: Had they the whole Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or Property of the Lands of <hi>Italy?</hi>

                  <speaker>Eng. Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours I reckon amongſt the Tyrants, for ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> were called thoſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens who uſurpt the Governments of their Crmmonwealths, and maintain'd it by force, without endeavouring to Found or Eſtabliſh it, by altering the Property of Lands, as not imagining that their Children could ever hold it after them, in which they were not deceived. So that it is plain that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was not a natural but a violent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The reaſons why it laſted longer than ordinarily Tyrannies do, are many; Firſt, becauſe
<hi>Auguſtus</hi> the firſt Emperour kept up the Senate, and ſo for his time cajold them with this bait of Imaginary Power, which might not have ſufficed neither to have kept him from the fate of his Uncle, but that there had been ſo many Revolutions and bloody wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, that all Mankind was glad to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and take breath for a while under any Government that could protect them. And he gain'd the ſervice of theſe Senators the rather, becauſe he ſuffered none to be ſo but thoſe who had followed his Fortune in the ſeveral <pb n="87" facs="tcp:107138:47"/>Civil Wars, and ſo were engaged to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him for their own preſervation; Beſides, he confiſcated all thoſe who had at any time been proſcribed, or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in any Encounter againſt him; which, conſidering in how few hands the Lands of
<hi>Italy</hi> then were, might be an over-ballance of the Property in his hands. But this is certain, that what ever he had not in his own poſſeſſion, he diſpoſed of at his pleaſure, taking it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as alſo the lives of his people, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any judicial proceedings, when he pleaſed: That the Confiſcations were great, we may ſee by his planting above ſixty thouſand Souldiers upon Lands in <hi>Lombardy;</hi> That is, erecting ſo many <hi>Beneficia,</hi> or <hi>Timarr</hi>'s, and, if any Man's Lands lay in the way, he took them in for Neighbourhood, without any delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency. <hi>Mantua vae miſerae nimium vicina Cremonoe.</hi> And it is very evident that if theſe <hi>Beneficia</hi> had not afterwards been made Hereditary, that Empire might have had a ſtabler Foundation, and ſo a more quiet and orderly progreſs than it after had; for the Court Guards, call'd the Praetorians, did make ſuch havock of <pb n="88" facs="tcp:107138:48"/>their Princes, and change them ſo often, that this (though it may ſeem a Paradox) is another reaſon why this Tyranny was not ruin'd ſooner; for the People, who had really an Intereſt to endeavour a change of Government, were ſo prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſeeing the Prince, whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſupplant, removed to their hand, that they were puzled what to do, taking in the mean time great recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſee thoſe wild Beaſts hunted down themſelves, who had ſo often prey'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Lives and Eſtates; beſides that, moſt commonly the frequent removes of their Maſters, made them ſcarce have time to do any miſchief to their poor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed Subjects in particular, though they were all Slaves in general. This Government of the later
<hi>Romans</hi> is a clear Example of the truth and efficacy of theſe Politick Principles we have been diſcourſing of. Firſt, that any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (be it the moſt unlimitted and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Monarchy) that is placed upon a right Baſis of Property, is better both for Prince and People, than to leave them a ſeeming Property, ſtill at his devotion, and then for want of fixing the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <pb n="89" facs="tcp:107138:48"/>expoſe their Lives to thoſe dangers and hazzards with which ſo many Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and Inſurrections, which muſt neceſſarily happen, will threaten them daily: And in the next place, that any violent conſtraining of mankind to a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, is not to be called a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor does ſalve either the Politick or Moral ends, which thoſe eminent Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators amongſt the Ancients propoſed to themſelves, when they ſet Rules to preſerve the quiet and peace, as well as the plenty, proſperity, and greatneſs of the People; but that the Politicks or Art of Governing is a Science to be learned and ſtudied by Counſellors and Statſemen be they never ſo great; or elſe Mankind will have a very ſad condition under them, and they themſelves a very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed and turbulent life, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a very deſtructive and precipitous end of it.</p>

                  <p>'Twas that I was coming to, before you were pleaſed to interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate me concerning the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> are this day, for ought I know, the only People that enjoy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and are Governed as a Province by any of the Eaſtern abſolute Princes. For whereas
<hi>Damaſco, Aleppo,</hi> and moſt of the other Cities and Provinces of that Empire, whoſe Territory is divided into <hi>Timarr's,</hi> are Governed by a Baſhaw, who for his Guards has ſome ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Janizaries or Souldiers; the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw of <hi>Egypt,</hi> or of Grand <hi>Cairo,</hi> has ever an Army with him; and divers Forts are erected, which is the way
<hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi> Princes uſe in Governing their Provinces, and muſt be ſo where Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty is left entire, except they plant Colonies as the
<hi>Romans</hi> did. The reaſon why <hi>Selim,</hi> who broke the Empire of the <hi>Mamalukes,</hi> and conquered <hi>Egypt,</hi> did not plant
<hi>Timarr's</hi> upon it, was the Lazineſs and Cowardlineſs of the People, and the great Fruitfulneſs of the Soil, and Deliciouſneſs of the Country, which has mollifi'd and rendred effeminate all the Nations that ever did Inhabit it. So that <pb n="91" facs="tcp:107138:49"/>a reſolution was taken to impoſe upon them, firſt the maintaining an Army by a Tax, and then to pay a full half of all the Fruits and product of their Lands (to the Grand Seignior) which they are to Cultivate and improve: This is well managed by the Baſhaws and their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and comes to an incredible ſum; the goods being ſold, the Money is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed <hi>in ſpecie</hi> to the Port, and is the greateſt part of that Prince's Revenue. And it is believed, that if all the Lands had been entirely confiſcated, and that the Grand Seignior had managed them by his Officers, he would not have made a third part ſo much of the whole, as he receives now annually for one half: not only becauſe thoſe People are extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly induſtrious where their own profit is concerned: but for that, it is clear, if they had been totally diveſted of their Eſtates, they would have left their Country, and made that which is now the moſt populous Kingdom of the World, a Deſart, as is all the reſt of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominions, except ſome Cities. And if the People had removed as they did elſewhere, there would not only <pb n="92" facs="tcp:107138:50"/>have wanted hands to have Cultivated and Improved the Lands, but mouths to conſume the product of it; ſo that the Princes Revenue by the cheapneſs of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, and the want of Labourers, would have almoſt fallen to nothing.</p>

                  <p>Pray God this be not the reaſon that this King of
<hi>France</hi> leaves Property to his Subjects; for certainly he hath taken example by this Province of <hi>Egypt,</hi> his Subjects having a Tax (which for the continuance of it, I muſt call a Rent or Tribute) Impos'd upon them to the value of one full half of their Eſtates, which muſt ever increaſe as the Lands improve.</p>

                  <p>I believe, Sir, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon; For the Property there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Nobility and Gentry, which are the hands by which he manages his Force both at home and abroad, it would not have been eaſie or ſafe for him to take away their Eſtates. But I come to the limited Monarchies. They were firſt Introduced (as was ſaid before) by the
<hi>Goths,</hi> and other Northern People. Whence thoſe great ſwarms came, as it was unknown to <hi>Procopius</hi> himſelf, who <pb n="93" facs="tcp:107138:50"/>liv'd in the time of their Invaſion, and who was a diligent ſearcher into all the circumſtances of their concernments, ſo it is very needleſs for us to make any enquiry into it, thus much being clear, That they came Man, Woman, and Child, and conquer'd and poſſeſt all theſe parts of the World, which were then ſubject to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and ſince Chriſtianity came in have been ſo to the Latin Church, till honeſt <hi>John Calvin</hi> taught ſome of us the way how to deliver our ſelves from the Tyrannical Yoak, which neither we nor our Forefathers were able to bear. Whence thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had the Government they Eſtabliſht in theſe parts after their Conqueſt, that is, whether they brought it from their own Country, or made it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, muſt needs be uncertain, ſince their Original is wholly ſo; but it ſeems very probable that they had ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent perſons among them, though the ignorance and want of learning in that Age hath not ſuffered any thing to remain that may give us any great light; for it is plain, that the Government they ſetled, was both according to the exact <pb n="94" facs="tcp:107138:51"/>Rules of the Politicks, and very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ſuitable to that Diviſion they made of their ſeveral Territories. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever then theſe Invaders had quieted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Province, and that the People were driven out or ſubdued, they divided the Lands, and to the Prince they gave uſually a tenth part, or thereabouts; to the great Men, or <hi>Comites Regis</hi> (as it was tranſlated into Latine) every one (as near as they could) an equal ſhare. Theſe were to enjoy an Hereditary right in their Eſtates, as the King did in his part and in the Crown; but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he, nor his Peers or Companions, were to have the abſolute diſpoſal of the Lands ſo allotted them, but were to keep a certain proportion to themſelves for their uſe: and the reſt was ordered to be divided amongſt the Free-men, who came with them to Conquer. What they kept to themſelves was called <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſnes</hi> in <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>French,</hi> and in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian, Beni Allodiali.</hi> The other part which they granted to the Free-men, was called a <hi>Feud:</hi> and all theſe Eſtates were held of theſe Lords Hereditarily, only the Tenants were to pay a ſmall <pb n="95" facs="tcp:107138:51"/>Rent annually, and at every Death or Change an acknowledgment in Money, and in ſome Tenures the beſt Beaſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides: But the chief condition of the <hi>Feud</hi> or Grant, was, that the Tenant ſhould perform certain Services to the Lord, of which one (in all Tenures of Free-men) was to follow him Armed to the Wars for the Service of the Prince and Defence of the Land. And upon their admittance to their <hi>Feuds,</hi> they take an Oath to be true Vaſſals and Tenants to their Lords, and to pay their Rents, and perform their Services, and upon failure to forfeit their Eſtates; and theſe Tenants were divided according to their Habitations into ſeveral Mannors, in every one of which there was a Court kept twice every year, where they all were to appear, and to be admitted to their ſeveral Eſtates, and to take the Oath above mentioned. All theſe Peers did likewiſe hold all their Demeſnes, as alſo all their Mannors, of the Prince; to whom they ſwore Allegiance and Fealty: There were beſides theſe Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Francklins, other Tenants to every Lord, who were called Villains, <pb n="96" facs="tcp:107138:52"/>who were to perform all ſervile Offices, and their Eſtates were all at the Lords diſpoſal when he pleaſed; theſe conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſtly of ſuch of the former Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of theſe Countries, as were not either deſtroyed or driven out, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly of others who were Servants a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, before they came from their own Countries. Perhaps thus much might have been unneceſſary to be ſaid, conſidering that theſe Lords, Tenants, and Courts, are yet extant in all the Kingdoms in <hi>Europe,</hi> but that to a Gentleman of <hi>Venice,</hi> where there are none of theſe things, and where the <hi>Goths</hi> never were, ſomething may be ſaid in excuſe for me.</p>

It is not my buſineſs to deſcribe particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the diſtinct Forms of the ſeveral Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments in <hi>Europe,</hi> which do derive from theſe People (for they may differ in ſome of their Orders and Laws, though the Foundation be in them all the ſame) this would be unneceſſary, they being all extant, and ſo well known; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, little to my purpoſe, excepting to ſhew where they have declined from their firſt Inſtitution, and admitted of ſome change. <hi>France,</hi> and
<hi>Poland,</hi> have not, nor as I can learn, ever had any Free-men below the Nobility; that is, had no Yeomen; but all are either No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or Villains, therefore the Lands muſt have been Originally given, as they now remain, into the hands of theſe Nobles. But I will come to the Adminiſtration of the Government in theſe Countries, and firſt ſay wherein they all agree, or did at leaſt in their inſtitution, which is, That the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power is in the States aſſembled <pb n="98" facs="tcp:107138:53"/>together by the Prince, in which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides; theſe make Laws, Levy Money, Redreſs Grievances, puniſh great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and the like. Theſe States conſiſt in ſome places of the Prince and Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity onely, as in <hi>Poland,</hi> and anciently in <hi>France</hi> (before certain Towns, for the encouraging of Trade, procured Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges to ſend Deputies; which Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are now called the third Eſtate) and in others, conſiſt of the Nobility and Commonalty, which latter had and ſtill have the ſame right to Intervene and Vote, as the great ones have both in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Spain,</hi> and other Kingdomes.</p>

                  <p>Yes, certainly, very pious men; ſome of them might be well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people, but ſtill ſuch as were cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by theſe holy men, who told them perpetually, both in publick and private, <hi>that they repreſented God upon Earth, being Ordained by Authority from him who was his Viceroy here, and that what was given to them was given to God, and he would repay it largely both in this World and the next.</hi> This wheedle made our barbarous Anceſtors, newly Inſtructed in the Chriſtian Faith (if this Religion may be called ſo, and ſucking in this fooliſh Doctrine more than the Doctrine of Chriſt) ſo zealous to theſe Vipers, that they would have pluckt out their eyes to ſerve them, much more beſtow, as they did, the fruitfulleſt and beſt ſituate of their poſſeſſions upon them: Nay, ſome they perſwaded to take upon them their Callings, vow Chaſtity, and give all they had to them, and become one of them, amongſt whom, I believe, they found no more ſanctity than they left in the World. But this <pb n="101" facs="tcp:107138:54"/>is nothing to another trick they had, which was to inſinuate into the moſt notorious and execrable Villains, with which that Age abounded; Men, who being
<hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>other great Men</hi> (for ſuch were the Tools they work'd with) had treacherouſly poiſoned, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe murdered their neareſt Relations, Fathers, Brothers, Wives, to reign, or enjoy their Eſtates; Theſe they did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade into a belief, <hi>that if they had a deſire to be ſav'd, notwithſtanding their execrable Villanies, they need but part with ſome of thoſe great poſſeſſions</hi> (which they had acquired by thoſe acts) <hi>to their Biſhopricks or Monaſteries, and they would pray for their Souls, and they were ſo holy and acceptable to God, that he would deny them nothing;</hi> which they immediately performed, ſo great was the ignorance and blindneſs of that Age; and you ſhall hardly find in the ſtory of thoſe times, any great <hi>Monaſtery, Abbey,</hi> or other

<hi>Goſpel</hi> preached, no <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> no continuance of

<hi>Prieſthood,</hi> or (as you call it, of true <hi>Miniſtry</hi>) by means of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination?</hi> do's not your own <hi>Church</hi> hold the ſame?</p>

                  <p>You will know more of my <hi>Church,</hi> when I have told you what I find the word <hi>Church</hi> to ſignifie in <hi>Scripture,</hi> which is to me the only rule of <hi>Faith, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Manners;</hi> neither do I ſeek theſe aditional helps, of <hi>Fathers, Councels,</hi> or
<hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> hiſtory, much leſs <hi>Tradition:</hi> for ſince it is ſaid in the word of God it ſelf, <hi>That Antichriſt did begin to work even in thoſe days;</hi> I can eaſily believe that he had brought his Work to ſome perfection, before the word <hi>Church</hi> was by him applied to the <hi>Clergy:</hi> I ſhall therefore tell you what I conceive that <hi>Church, Clergy,</hi> and <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:107138:55"/>ſignified in the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> times. I find then the word <hi>Church</hi> in the New Teſtament taken but in two ſences; the firſt, for the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Inviſible Church,</hi> called ſometimes of the <hi>Firſt-born;</hi> that is, the whole number of the true Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt in the World, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reſident, or into what part ſoever diſperſed. The other ſignification of <hi>Church</hi> is an
<hi>Aſſembly,</hi> which though it be ſometimes uſed to expreſs any
<hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> (even unlawful &amp; tumultuous ones) as well in Scripture as prophane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; yet it is more frequently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, for a gathering together to the Duties of <hi>Prayer, Preaching,</hi> and <hi>Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of
<hi>Bread;</hi> and the whole Number ſo Congregated is, both in the Acts of the Apoſtles, and in their holy Epiſtles, called the <hi>Church;</hi> nor is there the leaſt colour for appropriating that word to the
<hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> who ſince the Corruptions of
<hi>Chriſtian Religion</hi> are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Clergy;</hi> which word in the Old Teſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament is uſed, ſometimes for <hi>Gods whole People,</hi> and ſometimes for the <hi>Tribe of Levi,</hi> out of which the Prieſts were choſen: for the word ſignifies a <hi>Lot;</hi> ſo <pb n="104" facs="tcp:107138:56"/>that <hi>Tribe</hi> is called <hi>Gods Lot,</hi> becauſe they had no ſhare alotted them when the Land was divided, but were to live upon
<hi>Tythe,</hi> and ſerve in the functions of their <hi>Religion,</hi> and be
<hi>Singers, Porters, Butchers, Bakers,</hi> and <hi>Cooks,</hi> for the Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that this <hi>Tribe</hi> was ſtiled
<hi>Clergy</hi> but figuratively, and the Allegory paſſed into the New Teſtament, where the Saints are ſometimes called <hi>Clergy,</hi> but never the <hi>Paſtors</hi> or <hi>Deacons,</hi> who were far from pretending in thoſe days to come in the place of the <hi>Aaronical Prieſthood.</hi> The word <hi>Ordination</hi> in Scripture ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies lifting up of hands, and is uſed, firſt, for the giving a <hi>Suffrage,</hi> which in all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Aſſemblies was done by ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the hand (as it is in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Hall of <hi>London.</hi>) In the next place it is applied to the Order or Decree made by the <hi>Suffrage</hi> ſo given, which was then (and is yet too in all Modern Languages) called an <hi>Ordinance,</hi> and the
<hi>Suffrage</hi> it ſelf <hi>Ordination;</hi> which word proves that the firſt <hi>Chriſtian Churches</hi> were <hi>Democratical;</hi> that is, That the whole <hi>Congregation</hi> had the <hi>Choice</hi> in this, as well as the
<hi>Soveraign Authority</hi> in all <pb n="105" facs="tcp:107138:56"/>
                     <hi>Excommunications,</hi> and all other matters whatſoever that could occur; for in all <hi>Ariſtocratical Commonwealths</hi> the word for choice, <hi>is Keirotheſia,</hi> or <hi>Impoſition of hands,</hi> (for ſo the Election of all Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Officers was made) and not
<hi>Keirotoniae.</hi> Theſe <hi>Paſtors</hi> and other <hi>Officers</hi> did not pretend to be by virtue of ſuch <hi>Choice</hi> of a peculiar profeſſion different from other Men, (as their <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers</hi> have done ſince <hi>Antichriſts</hi> Reign) but were onely called and appointed (by the <hi>Congregations</hi> approval of their gifts or parts) to inſtruct or feed the Flock, viſit the ſick, and perform all other <hi>Offices</hi> of a <hi>true Miniſter</hi> (that is, Servant) of the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> at other times they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the buſineſs of their own <hi>Trades</hi> and
<hi>Profeſſions;</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in thoſe times (which none will deny to have been the <hi>pureſt</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi>) did never dream that a true <hi>Paſtor</hi> ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any
<hi>Succeſſion,</hi> to qualifie him for the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of the word; or that the <hi>Idle</hi> and <hi>Ridiculous Ceremonies</hi> uſed in your <hi>Church</hi> (and ſtill continued in that which you are pleaſed to call mine) were any way eſſential or conducing to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate a perſon to be a true <hi>Preacher</hi> or <pb n="106" facs="tcp:107138:57"/>

                  <p>I am not now to diſcourſe of <hi>Religion;</hi> it is never very civil to do ſo in Converſation of perſons of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent belief; neither can it be of any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit towards a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> for if his Conſcience ſhould be never ſo cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinc'd, he is not yet <hi>Maſter</hi> of his own <hi>Faith,</hi> having given it up to his
<hi>Church,</hi> of whom he muſt ask <hi>leave</hi> to be a <hi>Convert,</hi> which he will be ſure never to obtain; But if you have the Curioſity when you come amongſt the learned in your own <hi>Country</hi> (for amongſt our
<hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination-Mongers,</hi> there is a great ſcarcity of <hi>Letters</hi> and other <hi>good Parts</hi>) you may pleaſe to take the <hi>Bible,</hi> which you acknowledg to be the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> as well as we, and intreat ſome of them to ſhew you any paſſage, the plain and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine ſenſe of which can any way evince this <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> this
<hi>Ordination,</hi> or this <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> we are now ſpeaking of; and when you have done, if you will let your own excellent <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> judg, and not your <hi>Prieſt,</hi> (who is too much concerned in point of Intereſt) I make <pb n="108" facs="tcp:107138:58"/>no doubt but you will be convinced that the pretence to the diſpenſing of <hi>Divine things</hi> by virtue of a <hi>humane Conſtitution,</hi> and ſo ridiculous a one too, as the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> practiſed by your <hi>Biſhops</hi> and ours (who deſcend and ſucceed from one and the ſame <hi>Mother</hi>) is as little Juſtifiable by <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and full as great a <hi>Cheat</hi> and <hi>

<hi>Reaſon</hi> can come up to what you hold, yet the Novelty and the grace of this <hi>Argument</hi> has delighted me extreamly: and if that be a Sin, as I fear it is, I muſt confeſs it to my <hi>Prieſt;</hi> but I ask your pardon firſt, for putting you upon this long Deviation.</p>

                  <p>Well, this Digreſſion is not without its uſe, for it will ſhorten our buſineſs (which is grown longer than I thought it would have been) for I ſhall mention the Clergy no more, but when-ever I ſpeak of Peerage, pray take notice that I mean both Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Temporal, ſince they ſtand <pb n="109" facs="tcp:107138:58"/>both upon the ſame foot of Property. But if you pleaſe, I will fall immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſcourſe of the Government of <hi>England,</hi> and ſay no more of thoſe of our Neighbours, than what will fall in by the way, or be hinted to me by your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; for the time runs away, and I know the <hi>Doctor</hi> muſt be at home by noon, where he gives daily charitable audience to an Infinity of poor people, who have need of his help, and who ſend or come for it, not having the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to ſend for him, ſince they have nothing to give him; though he be very liberal too of his Viſits to ſuch, where he has any knowledg of them: But I ſpare his Modeſty, which I ſee is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned at the Juſt Teſtimony I bear to his Charity. The Soveraign Power of <hi>England</hi> then, is in King, Lords, and Commons. The Parliaments, as they are now conſtituted, that is, the aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a choice to ſuch a Number of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, as alſo the manner and form of Elections and Returns, did come in, as I ſuppoſe, in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, where now our Statute-Book begins; and I muſt confeſs, I was inclined to <pb n="110" facs="tcp:107138:59"/>believe, that before that time, our Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manry or commonalty had not formally aſſembled in Parliament, but been vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually included, and repreſented by the Peers, upon whom they depended: but I am fully convinced, that it was otherwiſe, by the learned Diſcourſes late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſht by Mr. <hi>Petit</hi> of the
<hi>Temple,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Attwood</hi> of <hi>grays-Inne,</hi> being Gentlemen whom I do mention <hi>hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris cauſa;</hi> and really they deſerve to be honor'd, that they will ſpare ſome time from the Mechanical part of their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings (which is to aſſiſt Clients with Counſel, and to plead their Cauſes, and which I acknowledg likewiſe to be honourable) to ſtudy the true Intereſt of their Country, and to ſhow how an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient the Rights of the People in <hi>England</hi> are, and that in a time when neither Profit nor Countenance can be hop'd for from ſo ingenious an undertaking. But I beg pardon for the deviation. Of the three branches of Soveraign Power which Politicians mention, which are Enacting Laws, Levying of Taxes, and making War and Peace, the two firſt of them are indiſputably in the Parliament;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:107138:59"/>and when I ſay Parliament, I ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with the King. The laſt has been uſually exercis'd by the Prince, if he can do it with his own Money: yet becauſe even in that Caſe it may be ruinous to the Kingdom, by expoſing it to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion, many have affirmed that ſuch a Power cannot be by the true and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent free Government of <hi>England,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be Intruſted in the hands of one man: And therefore we ſee in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Kings Reigns, the Parliament has been Conſulted, and their advice ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in thoſe matters that have either concerned War or Leagues; And that if it has been omitted, Addreſſes have been made to the king by Parliaments, either to make war or peace, according to what they thought profitable to the publick. So that I will not determine whether that power which draws ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences after it, be by the genuine ſence of our Laws in the Prince or no; although I know of no Statute or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Record which makes it otherwiſe. That which is undoubtedly the Kings Right, or prerogative, is to Call and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve Parliaments, to preſide in them, to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:107138:60"/>approve of all Acts made by them, and to put in Execution, as Supream or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Magiſtrate, in the Intervals of Parliaments, and during their Sitting, all Laws made by them, as alſo the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law; for which Cauſe he has the nomination of all Inferiour Officers and Miniſters under him, excepting ſuch as by Law or Charter are eligible other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; and the Power of the Sword, to force Obedience to the Judgements given both in Criminal and Civil Cauſes.</p>

                  <p>This Objection, <hi>Doctor,</hi> makes good what I ſaid before, that your skill did not terminate in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy natural, but extend to the Politick; for a more pertinent Interrogatory could never have been made by
<hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle:</hi> In anſwer to which, you may pleaſe to underſtand, That when theſe Conſtitutions were firſt made, our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors were a plain-hearted, well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People, without Court-reſerves or <pb n="113" facs="tcp:107138:60"/>tricks, who having made choice of this ſort of Government, and having Power enough in their hands to make it take place, did not foreſee, or imagine, that any thoughts of Invading their Rights could enter into the Princes Head; nor do I read that it ever did, till the <hi>Norman</hi> Line came to Reign; which coming in by Treaty, it was obvious there was no Conqueſt made upon any but <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,</hi> in whoſe ſtead <hi>William</hi> the Firſt came, and would claim no more after his Victory, than what <hi>Harold</hi> enjoy'd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting that he might confiſcate (as he did) thoſe great men who took part with the wrong Title, and <hi>French-men</hi> were put into their Eſtates; which though it made in this Kingdom a mixture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Normans</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> yet produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced no Change or Innovation in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; the <hi>Norman</hi> Peers being as tenacious of their Liberties, and as active in the recovery of them to the full, as the <hi>Saxon</hi> Families were. Soon after the death of
<hi>William,</hi> and poſſibly in his time, there began ſome Invaſions upon the Rights of the Kingdom, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat Grievances, and afterwards Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints <pb n="114" facs="tcp:107138:61"/>and Diſcontents, which grew to that height, that the Peers were fain to uſe their Power, that is, Arm their Vaſſals to defend the Government; whileſt the Princes of that Age, firſt King
<hi>John,</hi> and then <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, got Force together. The Barons call'd in <hi>Lewis</hi> the Dauphin, whilſt the King would have given away the Kingdom to the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> as he did to the Pope, and armed their own Creatures; ſo that a bloody War enſued, for almoſt forty years, off and on; as may be read in our Hiſtory: The ſucceſs was, that the Barons or Peers obtained in the cloſe two Charters or Laws for the aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Rights, by which neither their Lives, Liberties, or Eſtates, could ever be in danger any more from any Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power in the Prince; and ſo the good Government of <hi>England,</hi> which was before this time like the Law of Nature, onely written in the hearts of Men, came to be expreſt in Parchment, and remain a Record in Writing; though theſe Charters gave us no more than what was our own before. After theſe Charters were made, there could not <pb n="115" facs="tcp:107138:61"/>chuſe but happen ſome encroachment upon them: but ſo long as the Peers kept their greatneſs, there was no brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches but what were immediately made up in Parliament; which when-ever they aſſembled, did in the firſt place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Charters, and made very often Interpretations upon them, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the People; witneſs the Statute <hi>de Tallagio non concedendo,</hi> and many others. But to come nearer the giving the <hi>Doctor</hi> an anſwer, you may pleaſe to underſtand, that not long after the framing of theſe forementioned Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, there did ariſe a Grievance not foreſeen or provided for by them; and it was ſuch an one that had beaten down the Government at once, if it had not been Redreſſed in an Orderly way.

Soon after this laſt Act, the King, by reaſon of his Wars with <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and other great Affairs, was forced ſometimes to end his Parliaments abruptly, and leave buſineſs undone, (and this not out of Court-tricks, which were then unknown) which produced <pb n="118" facs="tcp:107138:63"/>another Act not long after, by which it was provided, That no Parliament ſhould be diſmiſt, till all the Petitions were anſwered; That is, in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of thoſe times, till all the Bills (which were then ſtyled Petitions) were finiſhed.</p>

                  <p>Pray, Sir, give me a little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this laſt Act you ſpeak of; for I have heard in Diſcourſe from many Lawyers, that they believe there is no ſuch.</p>

                  <p>Truly, Sir, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to you, that I do not find this Law in any of our Printed Statute Books; but that which firſt gave me the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of it was, what was ſaid about three years ago in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, by a worthy and Learned Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, who undertook to produce the Record in the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; and ſince I have queſtioned many Learned Counſellors about it, who tell me there is ſuch a one; and one of them, who is counted a Prerogative-Lawyer, ſaid it was ſo, but that Act was made in Factious times. Beſides, I think it will be granted, that for ſome time after, <pb n="119" facs="tcp:107138:63"/>and particularly in the Reigns of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, <hi>Henry</hi> the 5th, and <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th, it was uſual for a Proclamation to be made in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> before the end of every Seſſion, that all thoſe that had any matter to preſent to the Parliament, ſhould bring it in before ſuch a day, for otherwiſe the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at that day ſhould determine. But if there were nothing at all of this, nor any Record extant concerning it; yet I muſt believe that it is ſo by the Fundamental Law of this Government, which muſt be lame and imperfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; for it is all one to have no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments at all but when the Prince pleaſes, and to allow a power in him to diſmiſs them when he will, that is, when they refuſe to do what he will; ſo that if there be no Statute, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly becauſe our wiſe Anceſtors thought there needed none, but that by the very Eſſence and Conſtitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is provided for: and this we may call (if you had rather have it ſo) the Common-Law, which is of as much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue (if not more) than any Statute, and of which all our good Acts of Parliament <pb n="120" facs="tcp:107138:64"/>and
<hi>Magna Charta</hi> it ſelf is but Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; ſo that your Objection is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently aſwered in this, That though the King is intruſted with the formal part of ſummoning and pronouncing the Diſſolution of Parliaments, which is done by his Writ, yet the Laws (which oblige him as well as us) have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd how and when he ſhall do it; which is enough to ſhew, that the Kings ſhare in the Soveraignty, that is, in the Parliament, is cut out to him by the Law, and not left at his diſpoſal. Now I come to the Kings part in the Intervals of Parliament.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eng. Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I ſuppoſe you mean chiefly the Power of the Militia, which was, I muſt confeſs, doubtful, before a late Statute declar'd it to be in the King: For our Government hath made no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpoſal of the Militia than what was natural, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Peers in their ſeveral Counties, or Juriſdictions, had the Power of calling together their Vaſſals, either armed for the Wars, or <pb n="122" facs="tcp:107138:65"/>onely ſo as to cauſe the Law to be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by ſerving Writs; and in caſe of reſiſtance, giving poſſeſſion: which Lords amongſt their own Tenants did then perform the two ſeveral Offices of Lord-Lieutenant, and Sheriff; which latter was but the Earls Deputy, as by his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of
<hi>Vice-Comes</hi> do's appear. But this latter being of daily neceſſity, and Juſtice it ſelf, that is, the Lives, Liberties and Eſtates of all the People in that County depending upon it, when the greatneſs of the Peers decay'd (of which we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak hereafter) the Electing of Sheriff was referred to the County-Court, where it continued till it was placed where it now is by a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. For the other part of the Militia, which is, the Arming the People for War, it was <hi>de facto</hi> exerciſed by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the King, to a Lord-Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (as an image of the Natural Lord) and other Deputies; and it was tacitely conſented to, though it were never ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Statute (as I ſaid before) till His Majeſties happy Reſtauration. But to anſwer you, I ſhall ſay, That whatever Powers are in the Crown, whether by <pb n="123" facs="tcp:107138:65"/>Statute or by old Preſcription, they are, and muſt be underſtood to be intruſted in the Prince, for the preſervation of the Government, and for the ſafety and intereſt of the People; and when either the Militia, which is given him for the execution and ſupport of the Law, ſhall be imploy'd by him to ſubvert it (as in the caſe of Ship-Money it was) or the Treaſure ſhall be miſ-apply'd, and made the Revenue of Courtiers and Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants (as in the time of
<hi>Edward</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond) or worthleſs or wicked People ſhall be put into the greateſt places, as in the reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second; In this caſe, though the Prince here cannot be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable for it (as the Kings were in <hi>Sparta,</hi> and your Doges I believe would be) yet it is a great violation of the truſt repoſed in him by the Government, and a making that Power, which is given him by Law, unlawful in the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And the frequent examples of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice inflicted in Parliament upon the King's Miniſters for abuſing the Royal Power, ſhews plainly that ſuch autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is not left in his hands to uſe as he pleaſes. Nay, there have befallen ſad <pb n="124" facs="tcp:107138:66"/>troubles and dangers to ſome of theſe Princes themſelves, who have abuſed their Power to the prejudice of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; which although they are no way juſtifiable, yet may ſerve for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to Princes, and an example not to hearken to ruinous Councils: for men when they are enraged do not always conſider Juſtice of Religion, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being as natural to man as reaſon and vertue, which was the Opinion of divine <hi>Machiavil.</hi> To anſwer you then, I ſay, That though we do allow ſuch Powers in the King, yet ſince they are given him for edification and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and cannot be abuſed without great danger to his Miniſters, and even to himſelf; we may hope that they can never be abuſed but in a broken Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And if ours be ſo (as we ſhall ſee anon) the fault of the ill execution of our Laws is not to be imputed either to the Prince or his Miniſters; except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the latter may be, as we ſaid before, juſtly puniſhable for not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing the Prince to conſent to them end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the frame; of which we ſhall talk more hereafter: but in the mean time I <pb n="125" facs="tcp:107138:66"/>will come to the Kings other Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, as having all Royal Mines, the being ſerv'd firſt before other Creditors where mony is due to him, and to have a ſpeedier and eaſier way than his Subjects to recover his debts and his Rents, &amp;c. But to ſay all in one word, when there ariſes any doubt whether any thing be the king's Prerogative or no, this is the way of deciding it, <hi>viz.</hi> To conſider whether it be for the good and protection of the people that the King have ſuch a Power; For the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Prerogative is a conſiderable part of the Common Law, by which Power is put into the Prince for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of his People. And if it be not for the good of his Subjects, it is not Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, not Law, for our Prince has no Authority of his own, but what was firſt intruſted in him by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which he is Head; nor is it to be imagined that they would give him more Power than what was neceſſary to Govern them. For example, the power of pardoning Criminals condemned, is of ſuch uſe to the Lives and Eſtates of the People, that without it many would be <pb n="126" facs="tcp:107138:67"/>expoſed to die unjuſtly; As lately a poor Gentleman, who by means of the Harangue of a Strepitous Lawyer was found guilty of Murder, for a Man he never kil'd; or if he had, the fact had been but Man-ſlaughter; and he had been inevitably murdered himſelf, if his Majeſty had not been graciouſly pleaſed to extend his Royal Mercy to him; As he did likewiſe vouchſafe to do to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman convicted for ſpeaking words he never utter'd; or if he had ſpoken them, they were but fooliſhly, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiouſly ſpoken. On the other ſide, if a Controverſie ſhould ariſe, as it did in the beginning of the laſt Parliament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Houſe of Commons, and the Prerogative-Lawyers, about the choice of their Speaker, theſe latter having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted his Majeſty in the Conteſt, and made him, by conſequence, diſoblige, <hi>in limine,</hi> a very Loyal, and a very Worthy Parliament; and for what? for a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, which if you will decide it the right way, will be none: for ſetting aſide the Preſidents, and the Hiſtory when the Crown firſt pretended to any ſhare in the Choice of a Speaker, which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument <pb n="127" facs="tcp:107138:67"/>was very well handled by ſome of the Learned Patriots then. I would have leave to ask, what man can ſhew, and what reaſon can be alledged, why the protection and welfare of the People ſhould require that a Prerogative ſhould be in the Prince to chuſe the Mouth of the Houſe of Commons, when there is no particular perſon in his whole Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that would not think it againſt his intereſt, if the Government had given the King Power to nominate his Bayliff, his Attorney, or his Referree in any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitration? Certainly there can be no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage either to the Soveraign or his Subjects, that the perſon whoſe Office it is to put their deliberations into fitting words, and expreſs all their requeſts to his Majeſty, ſhould not be entirely in their own Election and appointment; which there is the more reaſon for too, becauſe the Speakers for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years paſt have received Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions from the Court, and have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Priviledges of the Houſe, by revealing their Debates, Adjourning them without a Vote, and committed many other Miſdemeanours, by which <pb n="128" facs="tcp:107138:68"/>they have begotten an ill underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the King and his Houſe of Commons, to the infinite prejudice both of his Majeſties Affairs, and his People. Since I have given this rule to Judge Prerogative by, I ſhall ſay no more of it; for as to what concerns the King's Office in the Intervals of Parliament, it is wholly Miniſterial, and is barely to put in Execution the Common Law and the Statutes made by the Soveraign Power, that is, by Himſelf and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, without varying one tittle, or ſuſpending, abrogating, or neglecting the Execution of any Act whatſoever; and to this he is Solemnly Sworn at his Coronation: And all his Power in this behalf is in him by Common Law, which is Reaſon it ſelf, written as well in the hearts of rational Men, as in the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers Books.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I have heard much talk of the Kings Negative Voice in Parliaments, which in my Opinion is as much as a Power to fruſtrate, when he pleaſes, all the endeavours and labours of his People, and to prevent any good that might accrue to the Kingdom by <pb n="129" facs="tcp:107138:68"/>having the right to meet in Parliament: for certainly, if we in <hi>Venice</hi> had placed any ſuch Prerogative in our Duke, or in any of our Magiſtracies, we could not call our ſelves a free People.</p>

                  <speaker>Eng. Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I can anſwer you as I did before, that if our Kings have ſuch a Power, it ought to be uſed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true and genuine intent of the Government, that is, for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Intereſt of the people, and not for the diſappointing the Counſels of a Parliament, towards reforming Grievances, and making proviſion for the future execution of the Lawes; and whenever it is applyed to fruſtrate thoſe ends, it is a violation of Right, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement of the King's Coronation-Oath; in which there is this Clauſe, That he ſhall <hi>Confirmare conſuetudines,</hi> (which in the Latine of thoſe times is <hi>leges</hi>) <hi>quas vulgus elegerit.</hi> I know ſome Criticks, who are rather Grammarians than Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, have made a diſtinction between <hi>elegerim</hi> and
<hi>elegero,</hi> and will have it, That the King Swears to ſuch Laws as the people ſhall have choſen, and not to thoſe they ſhall chuſe. But in my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, <pb n="130" facs="tcp:107138:69"/>if that Clauſe had been intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely to oblige the King to execute the Laws made already, it might have been better expreſt by <hi>ſervare conſuctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines,</hi> than by <hi>confirmare conſuetudines;</hi> beſides that he is by another clauſe in the ſame Oath ſworn to execute all the Laws. But I ſhall leave this Controverſie unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided; thoſe who have a deſire to ſee more of it, may look into thoſe quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling Declarations, <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> about this matter, which preceded our unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Civil Wars. This is certain, that there are not to be found any Statutes that have paſſed, without being preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Majeſty, or to ſome commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him; but whether ſuch Addreſſes were intended for Reſpect and Honour to His Majeſty, as the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons and the Lord May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of <hi>London</hi> are brought to him, I leave to the Learned to Diſcourſe; onely thus much we may affirm, That there never were yet any Parliamentary Requeſts, which did highly concern the Publick, preſented to any King, and by him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, but ſuch denials did produce very diſmal effects, as may be ſeen in our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories <pb n="131" facs="tcp:107138:69"/>ancient and late; it being certain, that both the Barons Wars, and our laſt diſmal Combuſtions, proceeded from no other cauſe than the denial of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces then reigning to conſent to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the States of the Kingdom: and ſuch hath been the wiſdom and goodneſs of our preſent gracious Prince, that in twenty years and ſomewhat more, for which time we have enjoy'd him ſince his happy Reſtauration, he hath not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd his Negative Voice towards more than one publick Bill; and that too, was to have continued in force (if it had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into an Act) but for ſix Weeks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for raiſing the Militia for ſo long time; and as for the private Bills, which are matters of meer grace, it is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable his Majeſty ſhould be refuſed that Right that every <hi>Engliſhman</hi> enjoys, which is not to be obliged to diſpence his favours but where he pleaſes. But for this point of the Negative Vote, it is poſſible that when we come to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Cure of our Political Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, ſome of you will propoſe the clearing and explanation of this matter, and of all others which may concern the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107138:70"/>King's Power and the Peoples Rights.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Noble Ven.</speaker>
                  <p>But pray, Sir, have not the Houſe of Peers a Negative Voice in all Bills? how come they not to be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to uſe it for the Publick Good?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eng. Gent</speaker>
                  <p>So they are, no doubt, and the Commons too; but there is a vaſt difference between a deliberative Vote which the Peers have with their Negative, and that in the Crown to blaſt all without deliberating. The Peers are Co-ordinate with the Commons in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting and hammering of Laws, and may ſend Bills down to them, as well as receive any from them, excepting in matters wherein the People are to be Taxed: and in this our Government imitates the beſt and moſt perfect Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths that ever were; where the Senate aſſiſted in the making of Laws, and by their wiſdom and dexterity, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht, fil'd, and made ready things for the more populous Aſſemblies; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by their gravity and moderation, reduced the People to a Calmer State, and by their authority and credit ſtem'd the Tide, and made the Waters quiet, giving the People time to come to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:107138:70"/>And therefore if we had no ſuch Peerage now upon the old Conſtitution, yet we ſhould be neceſſitated to make an artificial Peerage or Senate in ſtead of it: which may aſſure our preſent Lords, that though their Dependences and Power are gone, yet that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without them; and that they have no need to fear an annihilation by our Reformation, as they ſuffered in the late mad times. But I ſhall ſpeak a word of the peoples Rights, and then ſhew how this brave and excellent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>England</hi> came to decay.</p>
                  <p>The People by the Fundamental Laws, that is, by the Conſtitution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>England,</hi> have entire free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in their Lives, Properties, and their Perſons; nether of which can in the leaſt ſuffer, but according to the Laws already made, or to be made here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in Parliament, and duly publiſht: and to prevent any oppreſſion that might happen in the execution of theſe good Laws, which are our Birth-right, all Tryals muſt be by twelve Men of our equals, and of our Neighbourhood; Theſe in all Civil Cauſes judge abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107138:71"/>and decide the matter of Fact, upon which the matter of Law depends; but if where matter. of Law is in queſtion, theſe twelve Men ſhall refuſe to find a ſpecial Verdict at the direction of the Court, the Judge cannot Controul it, but their Verdict muſt be Recorded. But of theſe matters, as alſo of Demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Writs of Errour, and Arreſts of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have diſcours'd to this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman (who is a Stranger) before now; neither do's the underſtanding of the Execution of our Municipal Laws at all belong to this diſcourſe: Onely it is to be noted, that theſe Juries, or twelve Men, in all Trials or Cauſes which are Criminal, have abſolute Power, both as to matter of Law and Fact (except the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by Demurrer confeſs the matter of Fact, and take it out of their hands.) And the firſt queſtion the Officer asks the Foreman, when they all come in to deliver their Verdict, is this, Is he Guilty in manner or form as he is Indicted, or not Guilty? which ſhews plainly, that they are to Examine and Judge, as well whether, and how far the Fact commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is Criminal, as whether the perſon <pb n="135" facs="tcp:107138:71"/>charged hath committed that Fact. But though by the Corruption of theſe times (the infallible conſequences of a broken frame of Government) this Office of the Juries and Right of
<hi>Engliſhmen</hi> have been of late queſtion'd, yet it hath been ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectually vindicated by a learned Author of late, to whom I refer you for more of this matter. I ſhall ſay no more of the Rights of the People, but this one thing, That neither the King, nor any by Authority from him, hath any the leaſt Power or Juriſdiction over any
<hi>Engliſhman,</hi> but what the Law gives them; and that although all Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Writs go out in the King's name, yet his Majeſty hath no right to Iſſue out any Writ (with advice of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, or otherwiſe) excepting what come out of his Courts; nor to alter any Clauſe in a Writ, or add any thing to it. And if any perſon ſhall be ſo wicked as to do any Injuſtice to the Life, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Eſtate of any <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> by any private command of the Prince, the perſon agrieved, or his next of kin (if he be aſſaſſinated) ſhall have the ſame remedy againſt the Offender, as he <pb n="136" facs="tcp:107138:72"/>ought to have had by the good Laws of this Land, if there had been no ſuch Command given; which would be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely void and null, and underſtood not to proceed from that Royal and lawful Power which is veſted in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty for the Execution of Juſtice, and the protection of his People.</p>

                  <p>Now I ſee you have done with all the Government of
<hi>England;</hi> pray before you proceed to the decay of it, let me ask you what you think of the Chancery, whether you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it a Soleciſm in the Politicks to have ſuch a Court amongſt a free People; what good will
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi> the Petition of Right, or St. <hi>Edwards</hi> Laws do us to defend our Property, if it muſt be entirely ſubjected to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary diſpoſal of one man, whenever any impertinent or petulant perſon ſhall put in a Bill againſt you? How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent is this Tribunal with all that hath been ſaid in defence of our rights, or can be ſaid? Suppoſe the Prince ſhould in time to come ſo little reſpect his own honour and the Intereſt of his People, as to place a covetous or revengeful perſon <pb n="137" facs="tcp:107138:72"/>in that great Judicatory, what remedy have we againſt the Corruption of Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who make what Orders they pleaſe; Or againſt the whole Hierarchy of Knaviſh Clerks, whilſt not only the puniſhing and reforming miſdemeanours depend upon him, who may without controul be the moſt guilty himſelf, but that all the Laws of
<hi>England</hi> ſtand there arraigned before him, and may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned when he pleaſes? Is there, or ever was there any ſuch Tribunal in the World before, in any Countrey?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doctor,</hi> I find you have had a Suit in Chancery, but I do not intend to contradict or blame your Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Zeal in this point: This Court is one of thoſe Buildings that cannot be repaired, but muſt be demoliſhed. I could inform you how excellently mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Equity are Adminiſtred in other Countries; And this worthy Gentleman could tell you of the Venerable <hi>Quaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zia</hi>'s in his City, where the Law as well as the Fact, is at the Bar, and ſubject to the Judges, and yet no complaint made or grievance ſuffered: but this is not a place for, it this is but the ſuperſtructure; <pb n="138" facs="tcp:107138:73"/>we muſt ſettle the foundation firſt; every thing elſe is as much out of Order as this. Trade is gone, Suits are endleſs, and nothing amongſt us harmonious: but all will come right when our Government is mended, and never before, though our Judges were all Angels: this is the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum quaerite;</hi> when you have this, all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things ſhall be added unto you; when that is done, neither the Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (which is grown up to this ſince our Anceſtors time) nor the Spiritual Courts, nor the Cheats in trade, nor any other abuſes, no not the Gyant Popery it ſelf, ſhall ever be able to ſtand before a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, no more than one of us can live like a Salamander in the fire.</p>

                  <p>Therefore, Sir, pray let us come now to the decay of your Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that we may come the ſooner to the happy reſtauration.</p>

                  <p>This harmonious Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>England</hi> being founded as has been ſaid upon Property, it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it ſhould be ſhaken, ſo long as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty remain'd where it was placed: for if, when the ancient Owners the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> fled into the Mountains, and left
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:107138:73"/>their Lands to the Invaders (who divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them, as is above related) they had made an <hi>Agrarian</hi> Law to fix it; then our Government, and by conſequence our Happineſs had been for ought we know Immortal: for our Conſtitution, as it was really a mixture of the three, which are <hi>Monarchy, Ariſtocracy,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy</hi> (as has been ſaid) ſo the weight and predominancy remain'd in the
<hi>Opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> who poſſeſſed nine parts in ten of the Lands; And the Prince but about a tenth part. In this I count all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſhare to the Peers, and therefore do not trouble my ſelf to enquire what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion was allotted to them, for that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they had an Hereditary right in their Lands, yet it was ſo clog'd with Tenures and Services, that they depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as to publick matters, wholly on their Lords, who by them could ſerve the king in his Wars; and in time of Peace, by leading the people to what they pleaſed: Could keep the Royal Power within its due bounds, and alſo hinder and prevent the people from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the Rights of the Crown; ſo that they were the Bulwarks of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <pb n="140" facs="tcp:107138:74"/>which in effect was much more an <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> than either a <hi>Monarchy</hi> or
<hi>Democracy:</hi> and in all Governments, where Property is mixt, the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo too: And that part which hath the greater ſhare in the Lands, will have it too in the Juriſdiction: And ſo in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths, the Senate or the People have more or leſs Power, as they have more or fewer poſſeſſions; as was moſt viſible in <hi>Rome,</hi> where in the beginning, the <hi>Patricii</hi> could hardly bring the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to any thing; but afterwards, when the <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Conqueſts had inricht the Nobility to that degree, that they were able to purchaſe a great part of the Lands in <hi>Italy,</hi> the People were all their Clients, and eaſily brought even to cut the throats of their Redeemers the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> who had carried a Law for reſtoring them their Lands. But enough of this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I will not trouble my ſelf nor you, to ſearch into the particular cauſes of this change, which has been made in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions here in
<hi>England;</hi> but it is viſible that the fortieth part of the Lands which were at the beginning in the hands of the Peers and Church, is not there now; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <pb n="141" facs="tcp:107138:74"/>that not only all Villanage is long ſince aboliſhed, but the other Tenures are ſo altered and qualified, that they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing towards making the Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manry depend upon the Lords. The conſequence is, That the natural part of our Government, which is Power, is by means of Property in the hands of the People, whileſt the artificial part, or the Parchment, in which the Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is written, remains the ſame. Now Art is a very good ſervant and help to Nature, but very weak and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, when ſhe oppoſes her, and fights with her: it would be a very <hi>Impar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſus,</hi> between Parchment and Power: This alone is the cauſe of all the diſorder you heard of, and now ſee in
<hi>England,</hi> and of which every man gives a reaſon according to his own fancy, whileſt few hit the right cauſe: ſome impute all to the decay of Trade, others to the growth of Popery; which are both great Calamities, but they are Effects, and not Cauſes; And if in private Families there were the ſame cauſes, there would be the ſame effects. Suppoſe now you had five or ſix Thouſand pounds a year, as it is <pb n="142" facs="tcp:107138:75"/>probable you have, and keep forty Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and at length, by your neglect, and the induſtry and thrift of your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks, you ſell one Thouſand to your Steward, another to your Clerk of the Kitchen, another to your Bayliff, till all were gone; can you believe that theſe Servants, when they had ſo good Eſtates of their own, and you nothing left to give them, would continue to live with you, and to do their ſervice as before? It is juſt ſo with a whole Kingdom. In our Anceſtors times, moſt of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our Houſe of Commons thought it an honour to retain to ſome great Lord, and to wear his blew Coat: And when they had made up their Lord's Train, and waited upon him from his own Houſe to the Lords Houſe, and made a Lane for him to enter, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to ſit themſelves in the Lower Houſe of Parliament, as it was then (and very juſtly) called; can you think that any thing could paſs in ſuch a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that was not ordered by the Lords? Beſides, theſe Lords were the King's great Council in the Intervals of Parliaments, and were called to adviſe of Peace and <pb n="143" facs="tcp:107138:75"/>War; and the latter was ſeldom made without the conſent of the major part; if it were not, they would not ſend their Tenants, which was all the Militia of <hi>England</hi> (beſides the King's tenth part.) Can it be believed, that in thoſe days the Commons ſhould diſlike any thing the Lords did in the Intervals, or that they would have diſputed their Right to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Appeals from Courts of Equity, if they had pretended to it in thoſe days, or to mend Money-bills? And what is the reaſon, but becauſe the Lords themſelves at that time repreſented all their Tenants (that is, all the People) in ſome ſort? and although the Houſe of Commons did Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble to preſent their Grievances, yet all great Affairs of high Importance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Government, was Tranſact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Lords; and the War which was made to preſerve it, was called the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons Wars, not the War of both Houſes: for although in antienter times the word <hi>Baron</hi> were taken in a larger ſenſe, and comprehended the <hi>Francklins</hi> or <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> yet who reads any Hiſtory of that War, ſhall not find that any mention is made of the concurrence of any aſſembly <pb n="144" facs="tcp:107138:76"/>of ſuch men, but that <hi>Simon Monford</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and others of the great ones, did by their Power and Intereſt manage that conteſt. Now if this Property, which is gone out of the Peerage into the Commons, had paſſed into the King's hands, as it did in <hi>Egypt</hi> in the time of
<hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> as was before ſaid, the Prince had had a very eaſie and peaceable reign over his own Vaſſals, and might either have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, juſtly, to have Aſſembled the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any more; or if he had pleaſed to do it, might have for ever managed it as he thought fit: But our Princes have want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that is, a wiſe Councellor; and inſtead of ſaving their Revenue, which was very great, and their expences ſmall, and buying in thoſe Purchaſes which the vaſt expences and luxury of the Lords made ready for them, they have alienated their own Inheritance; ſo that now the Crown-Lands, that is, the publick Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, is come to make up the intereſt of the Commons, whileſt the King muſt have a precarious Revenue out of the Peoples Purſes, and be beholding to the Parliament for his Bread in time of Peace; whereas the Kings their Predeceſſors ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:107138:76"/>asked Aid of his Subjects, but in time of War and Invaſion: and this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone (though there were no other decay in the Government) is enough to make the King depend upon his People; which is no very good condition for a Monarchy:</p>

                  <p>Sir, I thank you for it, and ſhall endeavour to ſatisfie you. I ſhall ſay nothing of the ſmall Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> who keep in a great meaſure their ancient bounds, both of Government and Property; and if their Princes now and then exceed their part, yet it is in time of Troubles and War, and things return into their right Chanel of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the ſeveral States, which are yet in being every where: But
<hi>Germany</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo expoſed to the Invaſion of the <hi>Turks</hi> on the one ſide, and of the <hi>French</hi> on the other; and having ever had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough <pb n="146" facs="tcp:107138:77"/>to do to defend their ſeveral Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties againſt the encroachments of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> (in which the Imperial dignity is become in ſome fort Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) if there had been ſomething of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary power exerciſed of late years, I can ſay
<hi>Inter arma ſilent leges:</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their own particular States, they have the Diet of the Empire, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fails to mediate and compoſe things, if there be any great oppreſſon uſed by Princes to their ſubjects, or from one Prince or State to another. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore confine my ſelf to the three great Kingdoms, <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and
<hi>Poland;</hi> for as to <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden,</hi> the firſt hath lately chang'd its Government, and not only made the Monarchy Heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which was before Elective, but has pull'd down the Nobility, and given their Power to the Prince; which how it will ſucceed, time will ſhew.
<hi>Sweden</hi> remains in point of Conſtitution and Property exactly as it did anciently, and is a well-Governed Kingdom. The firſt of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther three is <hi>France,</hi> of which I have ſpoken before, and ſhall onely add, That though it be very true, that there is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty <pb n="147" facs="tcp:107138:77"/>in
<hi>France,</hi> and yet the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Deſpotical at this preſent, yet it is one of thoſe violent States, which the <hi>Grecians</hi> called Tyrannies: For if a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prince, that is, one who being ſo by Law, and ſworn to rule according to it, breaks his Oaths and his Bonds, and reigns Arbitrarily, he becomes a Tyrant and an Uſurper, as to ſo much as he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes more than the Conſtitution hath given him; and ſuch a Government, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as I ſaid violent, and not natural, but contrary to the Intereſt of the people, firſt cannot be laſting, when the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious props which ſupport it fail; and whilſt it does endure, muſt be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie both to Prince and People; the firſt being neceſſitated to uſe continual op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and the latter to ſuffer it.</p>

                  <p>You are pleaſed to talk of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the People under the King of <hi>France,</hi> and for that reaſon, call it a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Government, when, if I remember, you did once to day extol the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of the
<hi>Turks</hi> for well-founded and natural; Are not the people in that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire as much oppreſſed as in <hi>France?</hi>

                  <p>By no means; unleſs you <pb n="148" facs="tcp:107138:78"/>will call it oppreſſion for the grand Seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior to feed all his People out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his own Lands; and though they ſerve him for it, yet that does not alter the Caſe: for if you ſet poor men to work and pay them for it, are you a Tyrant, or rather, are not you a good Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths-man, by helping thoſe to live, who have no other way of doing it but by their labour? But the King of <hi>France</hi> knowing that his People have, and ought to have Property, and that he has no right to their Poſſeſſions, yet takes what he pleaſes from them, without their conſent, and contrary to Law; So that when he ſets them on work he pays them what he pleaſes, and that he levies out of their own Eſtates. I do not affirm that there is no Government in the World, but where Rule is founded in Property; but I ſay there is no natural fixed Government, but where it is ſo; and when it is otherwiſe, the People are perpetually complaining, and the King in perpetual anxiety, always in fear of his Subjects, and ſeeking new ways to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himſelf; God having been ſo merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to mankind, that he has made nothing <pb n="149" facs="tcp:107138:78"/>ſafe for Princes, but what is Juſt and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt.</p>

                  <p>But you were ſaying juſt now, that this preſent Conſtitution in <hi>France</hi> will fall when the props fail; we in
<hi>Italy,</hi> who live in perpetual fear of the greatneſs of that Kingdom, would be glad to hear ſomething of the decaying of thoſe props; What are they, I beſeech you?</p>

                  <p>The firſt is the greatneſs of the preſent King, whoſe heriock Actions and Wiſdom has extinguiſhed envy in all his Neighbour-Princes, and kindled fear, and brought him to be above all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of control at home; not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Subjects fear his Courage, but becauſe they have his Virtue in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and amidſt all their miſeries cannot chuſe but have ſomething of rejoycing, to ſee how high he hath mounted the Empire and Honour of their Nation. The next prop is the change of their ancient Conſtitution, in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh, by Conſent: for about that time the Country being ſo waſted by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion and Excurſions of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> The States then aſſembled Petitioned the King that he would give them leave to go
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:107138:79"/>home, and diſpoſe of Affairs himſelf, and Order the Government for the future as he thought fit. Upon this, his Succeſſor
<hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh, being a crafty Prince, took an occaſion to call the States no more, but to ſupply them with an <hi>Aſſemble des notables,</hi> which were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain men of his own nomination, like
<hi>Barbones</hi> Parliament here, but that they were of better quality: Theſe in ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reigns (being the beſt men of the Kingdom) grew Troubleſome and Intra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable; ſo that for ſome years the Edicts have been verified (that is in our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) Bills have been paſſed in the Grand Chamber of the Parliament at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Chambre d'au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> who lately, and ſince the Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment of Preſident
<hi>Brouſelles</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers during this King's Minority, have never refuſed or ſcrupled any Edicts whatſoever. Now whenever this great King dies, and the States of the Kingdom are reſtored, theſe two great props of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power are taken away. Beſides theſe two, the Conſtitution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, is ſomwhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fitted than ours to permit extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <pb n="151" facs="tcp:107138:79"/>Power in the Prince, for the whole People there poſſeſſing Lands, are Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen; that is, infinitely the greater part; which was the reaſon why in their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Eſtates, the Deputies of the Provinces (which we call here Knights of the Shire) were choſen by, and out of the Gentry, and ſate with the Peers in the ſame Chamber, as repreſenting the Gentry onely, called <hi>petite nobleſſe.</hi> Whereas our Knights here (whatever their blood is) are choſen by Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and are Commoners; our Laws and Government taking no notice of any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility but the perſons of the Peers, whoſe Sons are likewiſe Commoners, even their eldeſt, whileſt their Father lives: Now Gentry are ever more tractable by a Prince, than a wealthy and numerous Commonalty; out of which our Gentry (at leaſt thoſe we call ſo) are raiſed from time to time: For whenever either a Merchant, Lawyer, Tradeſman, Graſier, Farmer, or any other, gets ſuch an Eſtate, as that he or his Son can live upon his Lands, without exerciſing of any other Calling, he becomes a Gentleman. I do not ſay, but that we have men very No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <pb n="152" facs="tcp:107138:80"/>deſcended amongſt theſe, but they have no preheminence, or diſtinction, by the Laws or Government. Beſides this, the Gentry in <hi>France</hi> are very needy, and very numerous; the reaſon of which is, That the Elder Brother, in moſt parts of that Kingdom, hath no more ſhare in the diviſion of the Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Eſtate, than the Cadets or Younger Brothers, excepting the Principal Houſe, with the Orchards and Gardens about it, which they call <hi>Vol de Chappon,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, As far as a Capon can fly at once. This Houſe gives him the Title his Father had, who was called Seignior, or Baron, or Count of that place; which if he ſells, he parts with his Baronſhip, and for ought I know becomes in time
<hi>roturier,</hi> or ignoble. This practice divides the Lands into ſo many ſmall parcels, that the Poſſeſſors of them being Noble, and having little to maintain their Nobility, are fain to ſeek their Fortune, which they can find no where ſo well as at the Court, and ſo become the King's Servants and Souldiers, for they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Couragious, Bold, and of a good Meen. None of theſe can ever advance <pb n="153" facs="tcp:107138:80"/>themſelves, but by their deſert, which makes them hazard themſelves very deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately, by which means great numbers of them are kill'd, and the reſt come in time to be great Officers, and live ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly upon the King's Purſe, who is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very liberal to them, and according to their reſpective merits, gives them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, in the beginning of a Campagne, a conſiderable ſum to furniſh out their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage. Theſe are a great Prop to the Regal Power, it being their Intereſt to ſupport it, leſt their gain ſhould ceaſe, and they be reduced to be poor <hi>Provinciaux,</hi> that is, Country-Gentlemen again: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, if they had ſuch Eſtates as our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-Gentry have, they would deſire to be at home at their eaſe, whileſt theſe (having ten times as much from the King as their own Eſtate can yield them, which ſupply muſt fail, if the King's Revenue were reduced) are perpetually engaged to make good all exorbitances.</p>

                  <p>This is a kind of Governing by Property too, and it puts me in mind of a Gentleman of good Eſtate in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who took a Tenants Son of his to be his Servant, whoſe Father not long after <pb n="154" facs="tcp:107138:81"/>dying, left him a Living of about ten pound a year: the young Man's Friends came to him, and asked him why he would ſerve now he had an Eſtate of his own able to maintain him: his Anſwer was, That his own Lands would yield him but a third part of what his Service was worth to him in all; beſides, that he lived a pleaſant Life, wore good Clothes, kept good Company, and had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of very pretty Maids that were his Fellow-ſervants, which made him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well digeſt the name of being a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eng. Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>This is the very Caſe; but yet Service (in both theſe Caſes) is no Inheritance; and when there comes a Peaceable King in
<hi>France,</hi> who will let his Neighbours be quiet, or one that is covetous, theſe fine Gentlemen will loſe their Employments, and their King this Prop; and the rather, becauſe theſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen do not depend (as was ſaid before) in any kind upon the great Lords (whoſe ſtanding Intereſt is at Court) and ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in a change, be by them carried over to advance the Court-deſigns againſt their own good and that of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107138:81"/>And thus much is ſufficient to be ſaid concerning
<hi>France.</hi> As for <hi>Spain,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is no Country (excepting <hi>Sweden</hi>) in Chriſtendom, where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty has remained ſo intirely the ſame it was at the beginning; and the reaſon is, the great and ſtrict care that is taken to hinder the Lands from paſſing out of the old owners hands; for except it be by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, no man can acquire another man's Eſtate, nor can any Grandee, or Titula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, or any other Hidalgo there, alienate or ingage his Paternal or Maternal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, otherwiſe than for his Life; nor can alter Tenures, or extinguiſh Services, or diſmember Mannors: for to this the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces conſent muſt be had, which he never gives, till the matter be debated in the <hi>Conſejo de Camera,</hi> which is no <hi>Junta</hi> or ſecret <hi>Conſejo de Guerras,</hi> but one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the great men of the Kingdom inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene, and wherein the great matters concerning the preſervation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are tranſacted, not relating to Foreign Provinces or Governments, but to the kingdom of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Leon,</hi> of which I only ſpeak now. It is true, there have been one or two exceptions againſt <pb n="156" facs="tcp:107138:82"/>this ſevere Rule, ſince the great calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Spain,</hi> and two great Lordſhips have been ſold, the <hi>Marquiſate del Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtero,</hi> to an <hi>Aſſent iſta Genoeſe,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Sebaſtian Cortiza</hi> a
<hi>Portugueſe,</hi> of the ſame Profeſſion: but both theſe have bought the intire Lordſhips, without curtailing or altering the condition in which theſe two great Eſtates were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and notwithſtanding, this hath cauſed ſo much repining amongſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Godos</hi> (as the
<hi>Caſtilians</hi> call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſtill for glory) that I believe this will never be drawn into an Example hereafter. Now the Property remaining the ſame, the Government doth ſo too, and the King's Domeſtick Government, over his natural <hi>Spaniards,</hi> is very gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, whatever it be in his Conquer'd Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; and the Kings there have very great advantages of keeping their great men (by whom they Govern) in good temper, by reaſon of the great Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they have to beſtow upon them, both in <hi>Europe</hi> and the
<hi>Indies;</hi> which changing every three years, go in an Age through all the Grandees, which are not very numerous. Beſides, <hi>Caſtile</hi>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:107138:82"/>having been in the time of King <hi>Roderi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> over-run and Conquered by the <hi>Moors,</hi> who Governed there Deſpotical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſome hundreds of years, before it could be recovered again by the old In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, who fled to the Mountains; When they were at length driven out, the Count of <hi>Caſtile</hi> found a Tax ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Commodities whatſoever, by the <hi>Moors,</hi> in their Reign, called
<hi>Alcaval,</hi> which was an eaſie matter to get conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued (when their old Government was reſtored) by the <hi>Cortes,</hi> or States; and ſo it has continued ever ſince, as the Exciſe has done here, which being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by them who drove and kept out the King, does now ſince his happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration remain a Revenue of the Crown. This <hi>Alcaval,</hi> or Exciſe, is a very great Revenue, and ſo prevented, for ſome time, the neceſſities of the Crown, and made the Prince have the leſs need of asking Relief of his People, (the ordinary cauſe of diſguſt,) ſo that the <hi>Cortes,</hi> or Aſſembly of the States, has had little to do of late, though they are duly aſſembled every year, but ſeldom contradict what is deſired by the Prince; <pb n="158" facs="tcp:107138:83"/>for there are no greater Idolaters of their Monarch in the World than the <hi>Caſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are, nor who drink deeper of the Cup of Loyalty: ſo that in ſhort, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in <hi>Spain</hi> is as ours was in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, or in the firſt year after his now Majeſties Return, when the Parliament for a time Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plimented the Prince, who had by that means both his own Power and the Peoples: which days I hope to ſee again, upon a better and more laſting Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But before I leave <hi>Spain,</hi> I muſt ſay a word of the Kingdom of <hi>Arragon,</hi> which has not at all times had ſo quiet a ſtate of their Monarchy as <hi>Caſtile</hi> hath enjoyed; for after many Combuſtions which happened there, concerning their <hi>Fueros</hi> and
<hi>Privilegios,</hi> which are their Fundamental Laws, the King one day coming to his Seat in Parliament, and making his demands, as was uſual, they told him that they had a Requeſt to make to him firſt; and he withdrawing thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (for he had no right of ſitting there to hear their Debates) they fell into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe how to make their Government ſubſiſt againſt the encroachments of the <pb n="159" facs="tcp:107138:83"/>Prince upon them, and went very high in their Debates, whch could not chuſe but come to the king's ear, who walked in a gallery in the ſame Palace to expect the iſſue; and being in great Paſſion, was ſeen to draw out his Dagger, very often, and thruſt it again into the ſheath; and heard to ſay, <hi>Sangre ha de coſtar;</hi> which coming to the knowledg of the Eſtates, they left off the Debate, and ſent ſome of their number to him, to know what blood it ſhould coſt, and whether he meant to murder any body. He drew out his Dagger again, and pointing it to his breaſt, he ſaid, <hi>Sangre de Reys;</hi> leaving them in doubt, whether he meant that his Subjects would kill him, or that he would do it himſelf. However, that Parliament ended very peaceably, and a famous ſettlement was there and then made, by which a great perſon was to be choſen every Parliament, who ſhould be as it were an Umpire between the King and his people, for the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Laws, and the preſervation of their Government, their <hi>Fueros</hi> and <hi>Privilegios,</hi> which are their Courts of Juſtice, and their Charters. This Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:107138:84"/>was called. <hi>El Juſticia d' Arragon,</hi> and his duty was to call together the whole Power of the Kingdom, whenever any of the aforeſaid Rights were by open force violated or invaded, and to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the King, whenever he heard of any clandeſtine Councils among them to that effect. It was likewiſe made Treaſon, for any perſon of what quality ſoever, to refuſe to repair upon due ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to any place where this
<hi>Juſticia</hi> ſhould erect his Standard, or to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf without leave, much more to betray him, or to revolt from him: Beſides, in this <hi>Cortes,</hi> or Parliament, the old Oath which at the firſt Foundation of their State was ordered to be taken by the King at his admittance, was again revived, and which is in theſe words: <hi>Nos que valemos tanto camo nos, y podemos mas, os eligimos nueſtro Rey, conque nos guardeys nueſtros Fueros y Privilegios; y ſi no, no.</hi> That is, We who are as good as you, and more Powerful, do chuſe you our King, upon condition that you preſerve our Rights and Priviledges; and if not, not. Notwithſtanding all this, <hi>Philip</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, being both King of
<hi>Caſtile</hi> and <pb n="161" facs="tcp:107138:84"/>
                     <hi>Arragon,</hi> picked a quarrel with the latter, by demanding his Secretary <hi>Antonio Perez,</hi> who fled from the King's diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thither, being his own Country; and they refuſing to deliver him (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſly contrary to a Law of
<hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> that a Subject of that Kingdom ſhould be againſt his will carried to be tryed elſewhere) the King took that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to Invade them with the Forces of his Kingdom of <hi>Caſtile</hi> (who had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been Rivals and Enemies to the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goneſes</hi>) and they to defend themſelves under their <hi>Juſticia,</hi> who did his part faithfully and couragiouſly; but the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilians</hi> being old Soldiers, and thoſe of <hi>Arragon</hi> but County-Troops, the former prevailed, and ſo this Kingdom in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that of <hi>Caſtile</hi> by a Marriage (but an Age before) loſt its own Liberty and Government: for it is ſince made a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and Governed by a Vice-Roy from <hi>Madrid,</hi> although they keep up the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of their <hi>Cortes</hi> ſtill.</p>

                  <p>It may be they feared, That when <hi>Scotland</hi> was reduced to ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and the Province pacified, and Forces kept up there, That ſuch Forces and greater might have been imployed here, to reduce us into the ſame conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; an apprehenſion which at this time ſticks with many of the common People, and helps to fill up the meaſure of our Fears and Diſtractions. But the viſible reaſon why the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were not at that time very forward to oppreſs their Neighbours, was the conſideration, That they were to be Invaded for refuſing to receive from hence certain Innovations in matters of Religion, and the worſhip of God, which had not long before been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced here; and therefore the People of this Kingdom were unwilling to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate a Mungrel Church here, by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it upon them. But I do exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly admire, when I read our Hiſtory, <pb n="163" facs="tcp:107138:85"/>to ſee how zealous and eager our Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and People here were anciently to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the right of our Crown to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>France;</hi> whereas it is viſible, that if we had kept
<hi>France</hi> (for we Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it intirely and fully) to this day, we muſt have run the fate of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and been in time ruined and oppreſt by our own Valour and good Fortune; a thing that was foreſeen by the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> when their King <hi>Alexander</hi> had ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all
<hi>Perſia</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> who weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how probable it was, that their Prince having the poſſeſſion of ſuch great and flouriſhing Kingdoms, ſhould change his <hi>Domicilium Imperii,</hi> and inhabit in the Centre of his Dominions, and from thence Govern
<hi>Macedon,</hi> by which means the <hi>Grecians,</hi> who by their Vertue and Valour had Conquered and ſubdued the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> ſhould in time (even as an effect of their Victories) be oppreſt and tyrannized over by them: and this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautious foreſight in the <hi>Greeks</hi> (as was fully believed in that Age) haſtened the fatal Cataſtrophe of that great Prince.</p>

                  <p>I have no more to ſay of Foreign Monarchies, but only to tell you, That <hi>Poland</hi> is both Governed and Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by ſome very great Perſons or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, called <hi>Palatines,</hi> and under them by a very numerous Gentry; for the King is not onely Elective, but ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, that he has little or no Power, but to Command their Armies in time of War; which makes them often chuſe Foreigners of great Fame for Military Exploits: and as for the Commonalty or Country-men, they are abſolutely Slaves or Villains. This Government is extreamly confuſed, by reaſon of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merouſneſs of the Gentry, who do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways meet by way of repreſentation as <pb n="165" facs="tcp:107138:86"/>in other Kingdoms, but ſometimes for the choice of their King, and upon other great occaſions, collectively, in the Field, as the Tribes did at <hi>Rome;</hi> which would make things much more turbulent if all this body of Gentry did not wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend for their Eſtates upon the favour of the Palatines their Lords, which makes them much more tractable. I have done with our Neighbours beyond Sea, and ſhould not without your command have made ſo long a digreſſion in this place, which ſhould indeed have been treated of before we come to ſpeak of
<hi>England,</hi> but that you were pleaſed to divert me from it before: However, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed near the Portraicture of our own Country, it ſerves better (as <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traria juxta ſe poſita</hi>) to illuſtrate it: but I will not make this Deviation longer, by Apologizing for it; and ſhall therefore deſire you to take notice, That as in <hi>England</hi> by degrees Property came to ſhift from the few to the many, ſo the Government is grown heavier and more uneaſie both to Prince and People, the complaints more in Parliament, the Laws more numerous, and much more <pb n="166" facs="tcp:107138:87"/>tedious and prolix, to meet with the tricks and malice of men, which works in a looſe Government; for there was no need to make Acts <hi>verboſe,</hi> when the great Perſons could preſently force the Execution of them: for the Law of
<hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Firſt, for frequent Parliaments, had no more words than
<hi>A Parliament ſhall be holden every year,</hi> whereas our Act for a Triennial Parliament, in the time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, contained ſeveral ſheets of paper, to provide againſt a failer in the Execution of that Law; which if the Power had remained in the Lords, would have been needleſs: for ſome of them, in caſe of intermiſſion of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the Parliament, would have made their Complaint and Addreſs to the King, and have immediately removed the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, which in thoſe days had been the natural and eaſie way: but now that many of the Lords (like the Biſhops which the Popes make at <hi>Rome, in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus infidelium</hi>) are meerly grown Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and purchaſed for nothing but to get their Wives place, it cannot be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at if the King ſlight their Addreſſes, and the Court-Paraſites deride their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <pb n="167" facs="tcp:107138:87"/>undertakings for the ſafety of their Country. Now the Commons ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, as was ſaid, in the Property of the Peers and Church (whoſe Lands five parts of ſix have been alienated, and moſtly is come into the ſame hands with thoſe of the King and Peers) have inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited likewiſe, according to the courſe of nature, their Power; But being kept from it by the eſtabliſhed Government, which (not being changed by any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Acts of State) remains ſtill in being formally, whereas virtually it is aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that for want of outward Orders and Proviſions, the people are kept from the Exerciſe of that Power which is faln to them by the Law of Nature; and thoſe who cannot by that Law pretend to the ſhare they had, do yet enjoy it by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Right which is now ceaſed, as having been but the natural Effect of a Cauſe that is no longer in being; and you know <hi>ſublata cauſa, tollitur.</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay that the greater part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do know this their condition, but they find very plainly that they want ſomething which they ought to have; and this makes them lay often the blame
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:107138:88"/>of their unſetledneſs upon wrong cauſes: but however, are altogether unquiet and reſtleſs in the Intervals of Parliament; and when the King pleaſes to aſſemble one, ſpend all their time in Complaints of the Inexecution of the Law, of the multiplication of an Infinity of Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of Miſ-ſpending the Publick Monies, of the danger our Religion is in by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices to undermine it and the State, by endeavours to bring in Arbitrary Power, and in queſtioning great Officers of State, as the Cauſers and Promoters of all theſe Abuſes; in ſo much, that every Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeems a perfect State of War, wherein the Commons are tugging and contending for their Right, very juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and very honourably, yet without coming to a Point: So that the Court ſends them packing, and governs ſtill worſe and worſe in the Vacancies, being neceſſitated thereunto by their deſpair of doing any good in Parliament; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are forced to uſe horrid ſhifts to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without it, and to keep it off; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever conſidering, that if theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers underſtood their Trade, they might bring the Prince and People to ſuch <pb n="169" facs="tcp:107138:88"/>an Agreement in Parliament, as might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the broken and ſhipwrack'd Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of

                  <p>I beſeech you, Sir, how comes it to paſs, that neither the King, nor any of his Counſellors could ever come to find out the truth of what you diſcourſe? for I am fully convinced it is as you ſay.</p>

                  <p>I cannot reſolve you that, but this is certain, they have never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured a Cure, though poſſibly they might know the Diſeaſe, as ſearing that though the Effects of a Remedy would be, as was ſaid, very advantagious both to King and People, and to themſelves; yet poſſibly, ſuch a Reformation might not conſiſt with the Merchandize they make of the Princes Favour, nor with ſuch Bribes, Gratuities and Fees as they uſually take for the diſpatch of all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before them. And therefore our <pb n="170" facs="tcp:107138:89"/>Counſellors have been ſo far from ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting any ſuch thing to their Maſter, that they have oppoſed and quaſhed all Attempts of that kind, as they did the worthy Propoſals made by certain Members of that Parliament in the beginning of King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, which is yet called the Undertaking Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe Gentlemen conſidering what we have been diſcourſing of, <hi>viz.</hi> That our old Government is at an end, had framed certain Heads, which, if they had been propoſed by that Parliament to the King, and by him conſented to, would, in their Opinion, have healed the Breach; and that if the King would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his part, that Houſe of Commons would undertake for the Obedience of the People. They did believe that if this ſhould have been moved in Parliament before the King was acquainted with it, it would prove Abortive: and therefore ſent three of their number to his Majeſty; Sir <hi>James a Croft,</hi> Grandfather or Father to the preſent Biſhop of <hi>Hereford; Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Harley,</hi> who was Anceſtor to the Honourable Family of that Name in
<hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refordſhire;</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry Nevill,</hi> who
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107138:89"/>had been Ambaſſador from Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> King. Theſe were to open the matter at large to the King, and to procure his leave that it might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in Parliament: which, after a very long Audience and Debate, that wiſe Prince conſented to, with a promiſe of Secreſie in the mean time, which they humbly begged of His Majeſty. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this took Vent, and the Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Howard,</hi> who ruled the Roſt in that time, having knowledg of it, engaged Sir <hi>R. Weſton,</hi> afterwards Lord Treaſurer and Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> to impeach theſe Undertakers in Parliament before they could move their matters; which he did the very ſame day, accompanying his Charge (which was endeavouring to alter the eſtabliſhed Government of <hi>England</hi>) with ſo eloquent an Invective, that if one of them had not riſen, and made the Houſe acquainted with the whole Series of the Affair, they muſt have been in danger of being impeached by the Commons: but however it broke their deſigne, which was all that <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Weſton</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and prevented Poſterity from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107138:90"/>any of the Particulars of this Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; for nothing being moved, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could remain upon the Journal. So that you ſee our Predeceſſors were not ignorant altogether of our condition, though the Troubles which have befallen this poor Kingdom ſince, have made it much more apparent: for ſince the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of that Parliament, there has not been one called, either in that King's Reign, or his Son's, or ſince, that hath not been diſſolved abruptly, whilſt the main buſineſſes, and thoſe of moſt concern to the publick, were depending and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided. And although there hath happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Interim a bloody War, which in the Cloſe of it, changed the whole Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Foundation of the Polity of
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and that it hath pleaſed God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it again by his Majeſty's happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, ſo that the old Government is alive again; yet it is very viſible that its deadly Wound is not healed, but that we are to this day tugging with the ſame dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, managing the ſame Debates in Parliament, and giving the ſame diſguſts to the Court, and hopes to the Country, which our Anceſtors did before the Year <pb n="173" facs="tcp:107138:90"/>1640. whilſt the King hath been forced to apply the ſame Remedy of Diſſolution to his two firſt Parliaments, that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſed to his four firſt, and King <hi>James</hi> to his three laſt, contrary to his own vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Intereſt, and that of his people; and this for want of having Counſellors about him of Abilities and Integrity e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to diſcover to him the Diſeaſe of his Government, and the Remedy: which I hope, when we meet to Morrow Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning you will come prepared to enquire into; for the Doctor ſays, he will adviſe you to go take the Air this afternoon in your Coach.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall think it very long till the morning come: But before you go, pray give me leave to ask you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of your Civil War here; I do not mean the Hiſtory of it (although the World abroad is very much in the dark as to all your Tranſactons of that time for want of a good one) but the grounds or pretences of it, and how you fell into a War againſt your King.</p>

                  <p>As for our Hiſtory, it will not be forgotten; one of thoſe who was in Employment from the Year 40. to 60. <pb n="174" facs="tcp:107138:91"/>hath written the Hiſtory of thoſe 20 Years, a Perſon of good Learning and Elocution; and though he be now dead, yet his Executors are very unwilling to publiſh it ſo ſoon, and to rub a Sore that is not yet healed. But the Story is writ with great Truth and Impartiality, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Author were engaged both in Councils and Arms for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſide. But for the reſt of your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, you may pleaſe to underſtand, that our Parliament never did, as they pretended, make War againſt the King; for he by Law can do no Wrong, and therefore cannot be quarrelled with: The War they declared was undertaken to reſcue the King's Perſon out of thoſe Mens hands who led him from his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and made uſe of his Name to levy a War againſt them.</p>

                  <speaker>Noble Ven.</speaker>
                  <p>But does your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment permit, that in caſe of a diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the King and his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either of them may raiſe Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eng. Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>It is impoſſible that any Government can go further than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for its own Safety and Preſervation <pb n="175" facs="tcp:107138:91"/>whilſt it is in being, and therefore it can never direct what ſhall be done when it ſelf is at an end; there being this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between our Bodies Natural and Politick, that the firſt can make a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to diſpoſe of things after his death, but not the other. This is certain, that where-ever any two Co-ordinate Powers do differ, and there be no Power on Earth to reconcile them otherwiſe, nor any Umpire, they will, <hi>de facto,</hi> fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the Ears. What can be done in this Caſe <hi>de jure,</hi> look into your own Country-man <hi>Machiavell,</hi> and into <hi>Grotius,</hi> who in his Book
<hi>De jure Belli ac Pacis,</hi> treated of ſuch matters long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Wars. As for the ancient Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians, they muſt needs be ſilent in the Point, as having no mixt Governments amongſt them; and as for me, I will not reſt my ſelf in ſo ſlippery a Place. There are great diſputes about it in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Declarations before the War, and ſomething conſiderable in the King's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to them; which I ſhall ſpecifie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, when I have ſatisfied you how our War begun; which was in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: The Long Parliament having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured <pb n="176" facs="tcp:107138:92"/>from the King his Royal Aſſent for their Sitting till they were diſſolved by Act, and having paid and ſent out the Scottiſh Army, and disbanded our own, went on in their Debates for the ſettling and mending our Government: the King being diſpleaſed with them for it, and with himſelf for putting it out of his Power to diſſolve them, now the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which they pretended for their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuation was quite finiſhed, takes an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Reſolution to accuſe five prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Men of the Commons Houſe, and one of the Peers, of High-Treaſon: which he proſecuted in a new unheard-of way, by coming with armed Men into the Commons Houſe of Parliament, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their Members; but nothing being done by reaſon of the abſence of the five, and Tumults of diſcontented Citizens flocking to <hi>White-Hall</hi> and
<hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the King took that occaſion to abſent himſelf from his Parliament. Which indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Commons Houſe to ſend Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> to attend his Majeſty with <hi>a Remonſtrance of the State of the Kingdom,</hi> and an humble Requeſt to return to his Parliament, for the Redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <pb n="177" facs="tcp:107138:92"/>thoſe Grievances which were ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in that Remonſtrance. But the King, otherwiſe Counſelled, goes to <hi>Windſor,</hi> and thence Northwards, till he arrived at <hi>York;</hi> where he ſummons in the <hi>Militia,</hi> that is, the Trained-Bands of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and beſides, all the Gentry, of which there was a numerous Appearance. The King addreſſed himſelf to the latter with Complaints againſt a prevailing Party in Parliament, which intended to take the Crown from his Head; that he was come to them, his loving Subjects, for Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and, in ſhort, deſired them to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him with Moneys to defend himſelf by Arms. Some of theſe Gentlemen pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned His Majeſty to return to his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the reſt went about the Debate of the King's Demands; who, in the mean time, went to <hi>Hull,</hi> to ſecure the Magazine there, but was denied Entrance by a Gentleman whom the Houſe had ſent down to prevent the ſeizing it; who was immediately declared a Traytor, and the King fell to raiſing of Forces: which coming to the Knowledge of the Houſe, they made this Vote, <hi>That the King, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Evil Counſel, intended to levy War <pb n="178" facs="tcp:107138:93"/>againſt his Parliament and People, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Fundamental Laws and Liberties of</hi> England, <hi>and to introduce an Arbitrary Government,</hi> &amp;c. This was the firſt time they named the King, and the laſt: For in all their other Papers, and in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration to Arm for their Defence (which did accompany this Vote) they name no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Malignant Counſellors. The Kings Anſwer to theſe Votes and this Declaration, is that which I mentioned; wherein His Majeſty denies any inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of invading the Government, with high Imprecations upon himſelf and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity if it were otherwiſe: and owns that they have Right to maintain their Laws and Government. This is to be ſeen in the Paper it ſelf now extant; and this Gracious Prince never pretended (as ſome Divines have done for him) that his Power came from God, and that his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects could not diſpute it, nor ought he to give any Account of his Actions (though he ſhould enſlave us all) to any but him. So that our War did not begin upon a point of Right, but upon a matter of Fact; for without going to Lawyers or Caſuiſts to be reſolved, thoſe of the People who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved <pb n="179" facs="tcp:107138:93"/>that the King did intend to deſtroy our Liberties, joyned with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and thoſe who were of opinion that the prevailing party in Parliament did intend to deſtroy the King or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne him, aſſiſted vigorouſly His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with their Lives and Fortunes. And the Queſtion you were pleaſed to ask never came; for both parties pretended and believed they were in the right, and that they did fight for and defend the Government: But I have wearied you out.</p>

                  <p>As for the making new Laws, I hold it abſolutely needleſs, thoſe we have already againſt Arbitrary Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er being abundantly ſufficient, if they <pb n="184" facs="tcp:107138:96"/>might be executed; but that being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible (as I ſhall ſhew hereafter) till ſome change ſhall be made, I ſhall <hi>poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone</hi> this point: and for the firſt of your other two, I ſhall divide and ſeparate the conſideration of the growth of Popery from that of the Succeſſion. I am ſorry that in the proſecution of this Argument, I ſhall be forced to ſay ſomething that may not be very pleaſing to this worthy Gentleman, we being neceſſitated to diſcourſe with prejudice of that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he profeſſes; but it ſhall be with as little ill breeding as I can, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without paſſion or invectives.</p>

                  <p>It would be very hard for me to ſuſpect any thing from you that ſhould be diſobliging; but pray, Sir, go on to your Political diſcourſe, for I am not ſo ignorant my ſelf, but to know that the conſervation of the National Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (be it what it will) is aſſential to the well ordering a State: and though in our City the doctrinals are very different from what are profeſſed here, yet as to the Government of the State, I believe you know that the Pope or his Prieſts have as little influence upon it, as your <pb n="185" facs="tcp:107138:96"/>Clergy have here, or in any part of the World.</p>

                  <p>I avow it fully, Sir, and with the favour you give will proceed. It cannot be denyed but that in former times Popery has been very innocent here to the Government, and that the Clergy and the Pope were ſo far from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing our Liberties, that they both ſided with the Barons to get a declaration of them by means of <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> It is true alſo, that if we were all Papiſts, and that our State were the ſame, both as to Property and Empire, as it was 400 years ago, there would be but one incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to have that Religion National again in <hi>England,</hi> which is, That the Clergy, <hi>quatenus</hi> ſuch, had and will have a ſhare in the Soveraignty, and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Courts in their own Power, called Eccleſiaſtical; this is, and ever will be a Soleciſm in Government, beſides a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt contradiction to the words of Chriſt our Saviour, who tells us, his Kingdom is not of this World: and the truth is, if you look into the Scriptures, you will find, that the Apoſtles did not reckon that the Religion they planted ſhould be <pb n="186" facs="tcp:107138:97"/>National in any Country, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have given no precepts to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to meddle in matters of Faith and the Worſhip of God; but Preach'd, That Chriſtians ſhould yield them obedience in all lawfull things. There are many paſſages in Holy Writ which plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that the true Believers and Saints ſhould be but a handful, and ſuch as God had ſeparated, and as it were taken out of the World; which would not have been ſaid by them, if they had believed that whole Nations and People ſhould have been true Followers of Chriſt, and of his Flock: for certainly none of them are to be damn'd, and yet Chriſt himſelf tells us, that few are ſaved, and bids us ſtrive to get in at the ſtrait gate; and therefore I conceive it not to be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that either Chriſt or his Apoſtles did ever account that the true Religion ſhould be planted in the World by the framing of Laws, Catechiſms, or Creeds, by the Soveraign Powers and Magiſtrates, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you call them Spiritual or Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but that it ſhould have a Progreſs ſuitable to its beginning: for it is viſible that it had its Original from the Power
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:107138:97"/>and Spirit of God, and came in againſt the ſtream, not onely without a <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> or a <hi>Mahomet,</hi> to plant and eſtabliſh it by humane Conſtitutions and Authority, but had all the Laws of the World to oppoſe it, and all the bloudy Tyrants of that age to perſecute it, and to inflict exquiſite torments on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it, In <hi>Nero</hi>'s time (which was very early) the Chriſtians were offered a Temple in <hi>Rome,</hi> and in what other Cities they pleaſed, to be built to Jeſus Chriſt, and that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould receive him into the number of their gods; but our Religion being then in its purity, this was unanimouſly refuſed, for that ſuch a God muſt have no Companions, nor needed no Temples, but muſt be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped in Spirit and Truth. The Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors to theſe good Chriſtians were not ſo ſcrupulous; for within ſome Ages after, the Prieſts to get Riches and Power, and the Emperors to get and keep the Empire (for by this time the Chriſtians were grown numerous and powerful) combined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſpoil our Holy Religion, to make it fit for the Government of this World, &amp; to introduce into it all the Ceremonious fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies <pb n="188" facs="tcp:107138:98"/>and Superſtitions of the Heathen; and which is worſe, the Power of Prieſts, both over the Perſons and Conſciences of Men. I ſhall ſay no more of this, but refer you to innumerable Authors who have treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this Subject, particularly to a
<hi>French</hi> Miniſter, who hath written a Book, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>La Religion Catholique Apoſtolique Romaine inſtituee par Nume Pompile; and</hi> to the incomparable <hi>Machiavel</hi> in his <hi>Poſthume</hi> Letter, Printed lately in our Language, with the Tranſlation of his Works. But I have made a long digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and to come back again, ſhall onely deſire you to take notice, when I ſay that anciently Popery was no inconvenience in this Kingdom, I mean onely Political<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the Government then ſtood, and do not ſpeak at all of the prejudice which mens Souls did and will ever receive from the Belief of thoſe impious Tenents, and the want of having the True Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt preached unto them, but living in perpetual Superſtition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: The conſideration of theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters is not ſo proper to my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, being to Diſcourſe onely of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Notwithſtanding therefore, as I <pb n="189" facs="tcp:107138:98"/>ſaid before, that Popery might have ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well enough with our old Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet as to the preſent Eſtate, which inclines to Popularity, it would be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as inconſiſtent with it, and with the Power of the Keys, and the Empire of Prieſts (eſpecially where there is a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Juriſdiction in the caſe) as with the Tyranny and Arbitrary Power of any Prince in the World. I will add thus much in Confirmation of the
<hi>Doctor</hi>'s Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, That we ought to prevent the Growth of Popery, ſince it is now grown a Dangerous Faction here againſt the State.</p>

                  <speaker>Eng. Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>Sir, I will make you Judg of it your ſelf; I will ſay nothing of thoſe fooliſh Writings that have been put forth by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana, Emanuel Sa,</hi> and ſome others, about the lawfulneſs of deſtroying Princes and States in caſe of Hereſie, becauſe I know all the conſcientious and honeſt Papiſts (of which I know there are great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the World) do not only not hold, but even abhor ſuch curſed Tenents; and do believe, that when the Pope, by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:107138:99"/>hath cut off any Prince from the communion of the Church, can go no further, nor ought to pretend a Power to deprive him of his Crown, or abſolve his Subjects from their Oaths and Obedience: But I ſhall confine my ſelf to the preſent condition of our Papiſts here. You know how dangerous it is for any Kingdom or State to have a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, wealthy, flouriſhing party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, whoſe intereſt it is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Polity and Government of the Country where they live; and therefore if our Papiſts prove this Party, you will not wonder why this People are ſo eager to depreſs them. This is our Caſe: for in the beginning of Queen
<hi>Elizabeths</hi> reign, there was an alteration of Religion in our Country, which did ſufficiently enrage the Holy Father at <hi>Rome,</hi> to ſee that this good Cow would be Milked no longer. He declares her an Heretick and a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard, (his Sanctity not having declared null that inceſtuous Marriage which her Father had contracted before with his Brothers Wife, and which that King had diſſolved to Marry her Mother) and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Excommunicated our Queen, <pb n="191" facs="tcp:107138:99"/>depriving her, as much as in him lay, of the Kingdom; ſome of the Zealots of that Party (having a greater terrour for thoſe Thunder-bolts than I believe many have now) began to Conſpire againſt her; and Plots grew at length ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and ſo dangerous, that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary (as the Parliaments then thought) to ſecure the Queen, by making ſevere Laws againſt a People, who did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve themſelves her Majeſties Subjects; but on the contrary, many of them thought themſelves in Conſcience obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to oppoſe and deſtroy her: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that Excommunication, as alſo the pretended doubtfulneſs of the Title, both died with that renowned Queen, yet a new deſperate Conſpiracy againſt the King her Succeſſor and the whole Parliament enſuing, not long after her deceaſe, thoſe rigorous Laws have been ſo far from being repealed, that very many more, and far ſeverer, have been ſince made, and are yet in force. Now theſe Laws make ſo great a diſtinction between Proteſtants and Papiſts, that whereas the former are by our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Laws, the freeſt People in the <pb n="192" facs="tcp:107138:100"/>World, the latter are little better than ſlaves, are confined to ſuch a diſtance from their Houſes, are not to come near the Court, which being kept in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital City, moſtly deprives them from attending their neceſſary occaſions; they are to pay two third parts of their Eſtates annually to the King, their Prieſts are to ſuffer as Traitors, and they as Felons for harbouring them; in fine, one of us, if he do not break the Municipal Laws for the good Government of the Country, need not fear the King's Power, whereas their being what they are, is a breach of the Law, and does put them into the Princes hands to ruine them when he pleaſes; nay, he is bound by Oath to do it, and when he does it not, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained againſt by his People, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments take it amiſs. Now judge you, Sir, whether it is not the intereſt of theſe People to deſire and endeavour a change, whileſt they remain under theſe diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, and whether they are not like to joyn with the Prince (whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance at the inexecution of thoſe Laws is the onely means and hope of their preſervation) whenever he ſhall
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107138:100"/>undertake any thing for the increaſe of his own Power, and the depreſſing his Parliaments.</p>

                  <p>You ſpeak very well, and one of the Reaſons amongſt many which I have, to deſire a compoſure of all our troubles by a ſetled Government, is, that I may ſee theſe People (who are very conſiderable, moſt of them, for Eſtates, Birth and Breeding) live quietly under our good Laws, and increaſe our Trade and Wealth with their expences here at home; whereas now the ſeverity of our Laws againſt them, makes them ſpend their Revenues abroad, and inrich other Nations with the Stock of <hi>England;</hi> but as long as the State here is ſo unſetled as it is, our Parliaments will never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <pb n="194" facs="tcp:107138:101"/>to countenance a Party, who by the leaſt Favour and Indulgence may make themſelves able to bring in their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to be National, and ſo ruine our Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Liberties.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, Sir, for the Reaſon we Firſt gave, which is the crazineſs of our Polity, there being nothing more certain, than that both in the Natural and alſo the Politick Body any ſiniſter accident that intervenes, during a very Diſeaſed habit, may bring a dangerous al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration to the Patient. An Inſurrection in a decayed Government, a thing otherwiſe very inconſiderable, has proved very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, as I knew a ſlight fleſh-wound bring a luſty Man to his Grave in our Wars, for that he being extreamly infected with the <hi>French</hi> Diſeaſe, could never procure the Orifice to cloſe; ſo although the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns both at home and abroad, for alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Religion, would be very little formidable to a well-founded Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet in ſuch an one as we have now, it will require all our care to obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſuch Machinations. Another Reaſon <pb n="195" facs="tcp:107138:101"/>is the little Zeal that is left amongſt the ordinary Proteſtants, which Zeal uſes to be a great Inſtrument of preſerving the Religion eſtabliſh'd, as it did here in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time; I will add the little Credit the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the People, moſt men being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as angry with that Popery which is left amongſt us (in Surplices, Copes, Altars, Cringings, Biſhops, Eccleſiaſtical Courts, and the whole Hierarchy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides an Infinite number of Uſeleſs, Idle, Superſtitious Ceremonies, and the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Vitiouſneſs of the Clergy in general) as they are with thoſe <hi>Dogma</hi>'s that are aboliſhed; So that there is no hopes that Popery can be kept out, but by a company of poor People called Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks, who are driven into Corners as the Firſt Chriſtians were; and who only in truth Conſerve the Purity of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, as it was planted by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and is contained in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. And this makes almoſt all ſober men believe, that the National Clergy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all other good qualities have this too, that they cannot hope to make their Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy ſubſiſt long againſt the Scriptures,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107138:102"/>the hatred of mankind, and the Intereſt of this People, but by Introducing the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Religion, and getting a Foreign Head and Supporter, which ſhall from time to time brave and hector the King and Paliament in their favour and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, which yet would be of little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to them, if we had as firm and wiſe a Government as you have at
<hi>Venice.</hi> Another Reaſon, and the greateſt, why the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion ought to be very wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily provided againſt at this time, is, That the Lawful and Undoubted Heir to the Crown, if his Majeſty ſhould die without Legitimate Iſſue, is more than ſuſpected to Imbrace that Faith; which (if it ſhould pleaſe God to call the King, before there be any Remedy applied to our Diſtracted State) would give a great opportunity (by the Power he would have in Intervals of Parliament) either to Introduce immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately that profeſſion, with the help of our Clergy, and other <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Foreign Aids, or elſe to make ſo fair a way for it, that a little time would perfect the work; and this is the more formidable, for that he is held to be a very Zealous and Bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Romaniſt;</hi> and therefore may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed <pb n="197" facs="tcp:107138:102"/>to act any thing to that end although it ſhould manifeſtly appear to be contrary to his own Intereſt and Quiet; ſo apt are thoſe who give up their Faith and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their Lives to Prieſts (who to get to themſelves Empire, promiſe them the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Seats in Heaven; if they will ſacrifice their Lives, Fortunes, and Hopes, for the Exaltation of their Holy Mother, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the Damnation of an innumerable company of Souls which are not yet born) to be led away with ſuch Erroneous and wild Fancies. Whereas <hi>Philip</hi> the Second of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Houſe of
<hi>Guiſe</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Stateſmen, have always made their own greatneſs their firſt Aim, and uſed their Zeal as an Inſtrument of that; And inſtead of being cozen'd by Prieſts, have cheated them, and made them endeavour to Preach them up to the Empire of the World. So I have done with the Growth of Popery, and muſt conclude, that if that ſhould be ſtopt in ſuch manner, that there could not be one Papiſt left in <hi>England,</hi> and yet our Polity left in the ſame diſorder that now afflicts it, we ſhould not be one Scruple the better for it, nor the more at quiet; the Growth and Danger of Popery not being <pb n="198" facs="tcp:107138:103"/>the Cauſe of our preſent Diſtemper, but the Effect of it: But as a good and ſetled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would not be at all the nearer for the deſtruction of Popery, ſo Popery and all the Dangers and Inconveniences of it would not only be further off, but would wholly vaniſh at the ſight of ſuch a Reformation. And ſo we begin at the wrong end, when we begin with Religion before we heal our Breaches. I will borrow one Similitude more, with our Doctor's favour, from his Profeſſion. I knew once a man given over by the Phyſitians, of an incurable <hi>Cachexia,</hi> which they ſaid proceeded from the ill Quality of the whole Maſs of Blood, from great Aduſtion, and from an ill habit of the whole Body. The Patient had very often painful Fits of the Chollick, which they ſaid proceeded from the ſharpneſs of the humour which cauſed the Diſeaſe; and, amongſt the reſt, had one Fit which tormented him to that degree, that it was not expected he could out-live it; yet the Doctors delivered him from it in a ſmall time: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſoon after the man died of his firſt Diſtemper. Whereas if their Art had arrived to have cured that (which was the Cauſe of the other) the Chollick had vaniſhed of it <pb n="199" facs="tcp:107138:103"/>ſelf, and the Patient recovered. I need make no Application, nor ſhall need to ſay much of the Succeſſion of the Crown (which is my next Province) but this I have ſaid already, That it is needleſs to make any Proviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Popiſh Succeſſor if you rectifie your Government; and if you do not, all the Care and Circumſpection you can uſe in that Particular, will be uſeleſs and of none effect, and will but at laſt (if it do not go off eaſily, and the next Heir ſucceed peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, as is moſt likely, eſpecially if the King live till the People's Zeal and Mettle is over) end probably in a Civil War about Title; and then the Perſon deprived may come in with his Sword in his Hand, and bring in upon the Point of it both the Popiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and Arbitrary Power: Which, though I believe he will not be able to maintain long (for the Reaſons before alledged,) yet that may make this Generation miſerable and unhappy. It will certainly be agreed by all lovers of their Country, that Popery muſt be kept from returning, and being National in this Kingdom, as well for what concerns the Honour and Service of God, as the Welfare and Liberty of the People; and I conceive there are two ways by which
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:107138:104"/>the Parliament may endeavour to ſecure us againſt that danger; the firſt by ordering ſuch a change in the Adminiſtration of our Government, that whoever is Prince, can never violate the Laws, and then we may be very ſafe againſt Popery; our preſent Laws being effectual enough to keep it out, and no new ones being like to be made in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that may introduce it; and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy will be at the ſame time advantagious to us againſt the Tyranny and Incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Proteſtant Succeſſor, ſo that we may call it an infallible Remedy both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popery and Arbitrary power. The ſecond way is by making a Law to diſable any Papiſt by name or otherwiſe, from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting the Crown; and this is certainly fallible, that is, may poſſibly not take place (as I ſhall ſhew immediately;) and beſides, it is not improbable that an Heir to this Kingdom in future times, may diſſemble his Religion, till he be ſeated in the Throne; or poſſibly be perverted to the Roman Faith after he is poſſeſt of it, when it may be too late to limit his Prerogative in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and to oppoſe him without that, will I fear, be Judged Treaſon.</p>

                  <p>But Sir, would you have the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <pb n="201" facs="tcp:107138:104"/>do nothing, as things ſtand, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide (at leaſt, as much as in them lies) that whoever ſucceeds be a good Proteſtant?</p>

                  <speaker>Eng. Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I think it beſt in the firſt place to offer to his Majeſty the true Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; &amp; if they find him averſe to that, then to purſue the other which concerns the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, becauſe the People (who are their Principals, and give them their Power) do expect ſomething extraordinary from them at this time; and the moſt of them believe this laſt the only preſent means to ſave them from Popery, which they judge (and very juſtly) will bring in with it a change of Government. But then, I ſuppoſe, they may be encouraged to propoſe in the firſt place the true Cure; not only becauſe that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, as has been proved, but likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe His Majeſty in probability will ſooner conſent to any reaſonable Demand towards the Reforming of the Government, and to the ſecuring us that way, than to concur to the depriving his onely Brother of the Crown. And poſſibly this latter (as I ſaid before) may be the only way the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can hope will prove effectual: For if you pleaſe to look but an Age back into our Story, you will find that <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:107138:105"/>did procure an Act of Parliament, which gave him power to diſpoſe of the Crown by his laſt Will and Teſtament; and that he did accordingly make his ſaid Will, and by it deviſe the Succeſſion to his Son <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, in the firſt place, and to the Heirs of his Body; and for want of ſuch, to his Daughter <hi>Mary,</hi> and to the Heirs of her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and for want of which Heirs, to his Daughter <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> our once Soveraign of Immortal and Bleſſed Memory, and the Heirs of her Body; and for want of all ſuch Iſſue, to the right Heirs of his Younger Siſter, who was, before he made this Will, married to <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and had Iſſue by him. By this Teſtament he diſinherited his elder Siſter, who was married in
<hi>Scotland;</hi> and by that means did, as much as in him lay, exclude His Majeſty (who now, by God's Mercy, Reigns over us) as alſo his Father and Grandfather. And to make the Caſe ſtronger, there paſſed an Act long after, in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> That it ſhould be Treaſon during that Queen's Life, and a Premunire afterwards, to aſſert that the Imperial Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> could not be diſpoſed of by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: yet after the Deceaſe of that <pb n="203" facs="tcp:107138:105"/>Queen, there was no conſiderable Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made to the peaceable Reception and Recognition of King <hi>James</hi> of happy Memory. And thoſe who did make a little ſtir about the other Title, as the Lord <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Sir
<hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> and a few others, were apprehended &amp; condemn'd according to Law. And, notwithſtanding that, ſince, in the Reign of K.
<hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, there was a bloody Civil War, in which Men's Minds were exaſperated at a high rate; yet in all the Courſe of it, the Original Want of Title was never objected againſt His late Majeſty. I do not urge this to aver that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with the King's Conſent, cannot do lawfully this, or any other great Matter; which would be an incurring the Penalty of that Law, and a Soleciſm in the Politicks: But to ſhew, that when the Paſſions of men are quieted, and the Reaſons other than they were, it happens oftentimes that thoſe Acts which concern the Succeſſion fall to the Ground of themſelves, and that even without the Sword, which in this Caſe was never adoperated. And that therefore this Remedy in our Caſe may be likely never to take place, if it pleaſe God the King live till this Nation be under other kind of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>

                  <p>Sir, you ſay very well: but it ſeems to me, that the laſt Parliament was in ſome kind of Fault, if this be true that you ſay; for I remember that my Lord Chancellor did once, duringtheir Sitting, in His Majeſty's Name offer them to ſecure their Religion and Liberties any way they could adviſe of, ſo they would let alone meddling with the Succeſſion, and invited them to make any Propoſals they thought neceſſary to that end.</p>

                     <hi>Hinc ille lachrimae.</hi> If this had been all, we might have been happy at this time; but this Gracious Offer was <hi>In limine,</hi> accompanied with ſuch Conditions that made the Parliament conjecture that it was only to perplex and divide them; and did look upon it as an Invention of ſome new <hi>Romanza,</hi> (Counſellors and thoſe too, poſſibly, influenced by the <hi>French</hi>) to make them embrace the Shaddow for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and ſatisfying themſelves with this Appearance, to do their ordinary Work of giving Money, and be gone, and leave the Buſineſs of the Kingdom as they found it. For it was propoſed, that whatſoever Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity we were to receive, ſhould be both Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional and Reverſionable: That is, Firſt, <pb n="205" facs="tcp:107138:106"/>We ſhould not be put into Poſſeſſion of this new Charter (be it what it will) till after the death of His Majeſty who now is; whereas ſuch a Proviſion is deſirable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed neceſſary for us for this only reaſon, that when that unfortunate hour comes, we might not be, in that Confuſion, unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of a Calm, Setled and Orderly, as well as a Legal Way to keep out Popery. Whereas otherwiſe, if we be to take Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in that Minute, it muſt either miſcarry, or be gotten by a War, if it be true that Poſſeſſion be Nine Points of the Law in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caſes, it is in this the whole Ten: and I ſhould be very unwilling, in ſuch a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, to have no Sanctuary to fly to, but a piece of Parchment kept in the Pells; and to have this too, as well as other Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, in the Power and Poſſeſſion of him in whoſe prejudice it was made: this had been almoſt as good an Expedient to keep out Popery, as the Bill which was thrown out that Parliament; which provided, that in the Reign of a King that ſhould be a Papiſt, the Biſhops ſhould chuſe one another upon Vacancies. Thoſe Counſellors who put my Lord Chancellor upon this Propoſal, were either very ſlender Politicians themſelves or
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:107138:107"/>elſe thought the Parliament ſo. If <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and <hi>The Petition of Right</hi> had not been to take place till after the Deceaſe of thoſe Princes who confirmed them, neither had the Barons ſhed their Blood to ſo good purpoſe, nor the Members of the Parliament in <hi>Tertio Caroli,</hi> deſerved ſo Glorious an Impriſonment after it was ended. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Condition in this renowned Propoſal is, That all Proviſion and Security which is given us to preſerve our Religion, ſhall ceaſe immediately, whenever the Prince ſhall take a certain Oath to be penned for that purpoſe; and I leave it to all thinking men to determine what that will avail us, when we ſhall have a King of that Profeſſion over us, who ſhall not have ſo much Zeal for his Religion, as he who is now the next ſucceſſor hath; but ſhall poſſibly prefer his Ambition, and his deſire to get out of Wardſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scruples of his Confeſſor; and yet may afterwards, by getting Abſolution for, and Diſpenſation from ſuch Oaths and Compliance, employ the Power he gets himſelf, and the Security he deprives us of, to introduce violently what Worſhip and Faith he pleaſes. This Gracious Offer had the fatality to diſguiſt one of the beſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <pb n="207" facs="tcp:107138:107"/>that ever Sate, and the moſt Loyal; ſo that laying it aſide, they fell upon the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, the only thing they had then left, and were ſoon after Diſſolved, leaving the Kingdom in a more diſtracted Condition than they found it; and this can no way be compoſed, but by mending the Polity, ſo that whoever is King cannot (be he never ſo inclined to it) introduce Popery, or deſtroy whatever Religion ſhall be eſtabliſhed: as you ſee in the Example of the Dutchy of <hi>Hanover,</hi> whoſe Prince ſome fourteen Years ſince, was perverted to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, went to <hi>Rome</hi> to abjure Hereſie (as they call the truth) return'd home, where he lived and Governed as he did before, without the leaſt Animoſity of his Subjects for his Change, or any endeavour of his to Introduce any in his Government or People, and dying this laſt Spring, left the Peaceable and undiſturbed Rule of his Subjects to the next Succeſſor, his Brother the Biſhop of <hi>Oſnaburg,</hi> who is a Proteſtant, and this becauſe the Polity of that Dukedom has been conſerved entire for many years, and is upon a right Baſis: and if our Caſe were ſo, we ſhould not onely be out of danger to have our Religion altered (as I ſaid before) whoever is King, but ſhould <pb n="208" facs="tcp:107138:108"/>in other things be in a happy and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition. But I have made a long and tedious digreſſion to anſwer your demands: Now 'tis time you aſſiſt me to find the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cure of all our Miſchiefs.</p>

                  <p>Sir, you have no reaſon to take that for granted, when you ſee what Books are Printed, what great and Honourable Perſons frequent him in private, and countenance him in publick; what ſhoals of the middle ſort of people have in his Progreſs this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer met him before he came into any great Town, and what Acclamations and Bon-fires have been made in places where he lodged.</p>

                  <p>Well, I ſee I muſt be more tedious than I intended; Firſt then, the <pb n="210" facs="tcp:107138:109"/>reaſoning of theſe men you ſpeak of, does in my apprehenſion, ſuppoſe a thing I cannot mention without horrour, which is, That this Perſon ſhould be admitted immediately to the Poſſeſſion of the Crown to do all theſe fine Matters; for otherwiſe, if he muſt ſtay till the Death of our Soveraign who now Reigns (which I hope and pray will be many years) poſſibly theſe delicate Bills may never paſs, nor he find hereafter the People in ſo good a humour to admit him to the Reverſion, which if it could be obtain'd (as I think it impoſſible Politically) yet the Poſſeſſion muſt be kept by a ſtanding Army, and the next Succeſſour cannot have a better Game to play, nor a better Adverſary to deal with, than one who leaps in over the Heads of almoſt all the Proteſtant Princes Families abroad, beſides ſome Papiſts who are greater; and when we have been harraſſed with Wars, and the miſeries that accompany it ſome few years, you ſhall have all theſe fine People, who now run after him, very weary of their new Prince: I would not ſay any thing to diſparage a Perſon ſo highly born, and of ſo early merit; but this I may ſay, <pb n="211" facs="tcp:107138:109"/>That if a Lawful Title ſhould be ſet on foot in his favour, and a thouſand <hi>Dutch</hi> Hoſts, and ſuch like, ſhould ſwear a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, yet no ſober Man, that is not blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with prejudice, will believe, That our King (whom none can deny to have an excellent underſtanding) would ever Marry a Woman ſo much his Inferiour as this great Perſons Mother was; and this at a time when his Affairs were very low, and he had no viſible or rational hopes to be reſtored to the Poſſeſſion of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms but by an aſſiſtance which might have been afforded him by means of ſome great Foreign Alliance. Well, but to leave all this, do theſe Men pretend that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ſhall be declared Succeſſour to the Crown in Parliament, with the King's Concurence or without it; if without it, you muſt make a War for it, and I am ſure that no Cauſe can be ſtated upon ſuch a point, that will not make the Aſſertors and Undertakers of it be condemned by all the Politicians and Moraliſts of the World, and by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts of all Religions, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, it is like to be a very unſuccesful War. If you would have this declar'd <pb n="212" facs="tcp:107138:110"/>with the King's Conſent, either you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Royal aſſent to be given, when the King has his liberty either to grant it, or not grant it, to Diſſolve the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or not Diſſolve it, without ruine or prejudice to his Affairs: If in the firſt Caſe, it is plain he will not grant it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot do it without confeſſing his Marriage to that Duke's Mother, which he hath already declared againſt in a very ſolemn manner, and cauſed it to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred in Chancery; and which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no good Subject can chuſe but believe, but which cannot be doubted by any rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal perſon; for it would be a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, and indeed a thing unheard of, that a Father who had a Son in Lawful Matrimony, and who was grown to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and had ſignalized himſelf in the Wars, and who was ever intirely beloved by him, ſhould diſinherit him by ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn an aſſeveration (which muſt be a falſe one too) to cauſe his Brother to ſucceed in his room. And whereas it is pretended by ſome, that His Majeſties danger from his Brothers Counſels and Deſigns may draw from him ſomething of this; beſide that they do not much Complement the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:107138:110"/>King in this, it is clear, his Brother is not ſo Popular, but that he may ſecure him when he pleaſes, without hazard, if there were any ground for ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. But we muſt in the next place ſuppoſe that the King's Affairs were in ſuch a poſture, that he could deny the Parliament nothing without very great miſchief, and inconvenience to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the Kingdom; then I ſay, I doubt not, but the Wiſdom of the Parliament will find out divers Demands and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts to make to His Majeſty of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er benefit, and more neceſſary for the good of his People than this would be; which draws after it not only a preſent unſetledneſs, but the probable hazard of Miſery and Devaſtation for many years to come, as has been proved. So that as on the one ſide the Parliament could not make a more unjuſtfiable War than upon this Account, ſo they could not be Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon any occaſion wherein the People would not ſhew leſs diſcontent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and for which the Courtiers would not hope to have a better pretext to ſtrive in the next Choice to make their Arts and endeavours more ſucceſsful in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:107138:111"/>the Election of Members more ſuitable to their Deſigns for the continuance of this preſent miſ-government; For if this Parliament do miſ-ſpend the Peoples Mettle, which is now up, in driving that Nail which cannot go, they muſt look to have it cool, and ſo the Ship of this Commonwealth, which if they pleaſe may be now in a fair way of Entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Safe Harbour, will be driven to Sea again in a Storm, and muſt hope for, and expect another favourable Wind to ſave them; and God knows when that may come.</p>

                  <p>Doctor, I will keep the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Prophecy, which I have gained with you, and not hazard it with any new predictions, for fear they ſhould miſcarry; yet I care not, if I gratifie your curioſity a little in the point, about which you firſt began to Interrogate me, by preſaging to you, that in caſe we ſhould have troubles, and combuſtions here, after his Majeſties deceaſe (which God avert) we muſt expect a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuccesful end of them, if we ſhould be ſo raſh and unadviſed, as to make the great Perſon we have been lately ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, our head; and that nothing can be more dangerous and pernitious to us than ſuch a choice. I have not in this diſcourſe the leaſt intention to except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, much leſs to diſparage the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <pb n="220" facs="tcp:107138:114"/>worth of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> which the world knows to be very great, but do believe that he hath Courage and Conduct proportionable to any imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can be conferred upon him, whether it be to manage Arms, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; but my opinion is, that no perſon in his circumſtance can be a proper head in this caſe; for the people having been already put on upon his ſcent of the
<hi>title</hi> to the <hi>Crown,</hi> will be very hardly called off, and ſo will force the wiſer men, who may deſign better things, to conſent that he be Proclaimed <hi>King</hi> immediately, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be ſome other head, who by his Power, Wiſdom, and Authority, may reſtrain the forwardneſs of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and obviate the acts of ſome men, whoſe intereſt and hopes may prompt them to foment the humours of the people. Now the conſequences of hurrying a man to the Throne ſo tumultuouſly, without the leaſt deliberation, are very diſmal; and do not only not cure the politick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of our Countrey, which we have talked ſo much of, but do infinitely augment it, and add to the deſeaſe our State labours under already (which is a <pb n="221" facs="tcp:107138:114"/>Conſumption) a very violent Feaver too; I mean War at home, and from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, which muſt neceſſarily follow in a few years: nor is it poſſible to go back, when once we have made that ſtep; for our <hi>new King</hi> will call a <hi>Parliament,</hi> which being

                  <p>It ſeems to me, that there needs nothing more than that; for if he conſent to all Laws as ſhall be preſented to him, you may reform your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſufficiently, or elſe it is your own fault.</p>

                  <p>We have ſhewed already, and ſhall do more hereafter, that no Laws can be executed till our government be mended; and if you mean we ſhould make ſuch as ſhould mend that (beſides that it would be a better method to capitulate that, before you make choice of your <hi>Prince,</hi> as wiſe people have done in all ages, and the <hi>Cardinals</hi> do at
<hi>Rome</hi> in the <hi>Conclave</hi> before they chooſe their
<hi>Pope</hi>) I ſay beſides this, it is not to be taken for
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:107138:115"/>granted that any Bills that tend to make conſiderable alterations in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (and ſuch we have need of, as you will ſee anon) would either in that caſe be offered or conſented to; both
<hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>People</hi> being ſo ready to cry out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Forty-one,</hi> and to be frighted with the name of a
<hi>Common-wealth,</hi> even now when we think <hi>Popery</hi> is at the door; which ſome people then will think farther off, and ſo not care to make ſo great alterations to keep it out; beſides the great Men and favourites of the new <hi>Prince</hi> will think it hard that their King ſhould be ſo bounded and limited both in power and Revenue, that he ſhall have no means to exerciſe his liberality towards them, and ſo may uſe their intereſt and eloquence in both Houſes to diſſuade them from preſſing ſo hard upon a Prince who is a true zealous Proteſtant, and has alwaies headed that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and who is juſtly admired, if not ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the people; and conſidering too that all the power they leave him, will ſerve but to enable him to defend us the better from Popery and Arbitrary power; for which latter Monarchy was firſt Inſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thus we may exerciſe during a
<hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:107138:115"/>or two, love-tricks between the Prince and his people, and imitate the hony-moon that continued for about two years after his Majeſties Reſtauration till the ill management of affairs and the new grevances that ſhall ariſe (which will be ſure never to fail till our true cure be effected, notwithſtanding the care of the new King and his Councellors) ſhall awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the diſcontents of the people, and then they will curſe the time in which they made this election of a Prince, and the great men for not hindring them. Then men will be reckoning up the diſcontents of the Peers, ſometime after they had made a raſh choice of
<hi>H.</hi> the 7th in the field, who (had then no title) when they ſaw how he made uſe of the power they gave him to leſſen their greatneſs, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie himſelf upon their ruins; when it comes to this, and that the Governing party comes to be but a little faction, the people (who never know the true cauſe of their diſtemper) will be looking out abroad who has the Lawful title (if the next Heir be not in the mean time with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Strangers</hi> in the field here, as is moſt likely) and look upon the <pb n="224" facs="tcp:107138:116"/>
                     <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Orange,</hi> or the next of kin, as their future Saviour (in caſe the
<hi>Duke</hi> be dead in the mean time, and ſo the cauſe of all their diſtruſt taken away) thus moſt men, not only diſcontented perſons, but the people in general, lookt upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty that now is, as their future deliverer during our late diſtractions, when his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was ſo weak that he had ſcarce wherewithall to ſubſiſt, and his enemies powerful at home and victorious abroad, which will not be I fear, our caſe. I Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy then (becauſe you will have me uſe this word) that if Nobles or people make any ſuch unfortunate choice as this during the diſtractions we may be in upon his Majeſties death, we ſhall not only miſs our cure, or have it deferred till another Government make it; but remain in the confuſion we now ſuffer under; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that ſhall be ſure to feel, firſt or laſt, the calamity of a Civil and Foreign War, and in the mean time to be in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual fear of it, and ſuffer all the burden and charge which is neceſſary to provide for it, beſides all the other ill conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a ſtanding Army. To conclude, I aſſure you in the Faith of a Chriſtian,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:107138:116"/>that I have made this diſcourſe ſolely and ſingly out of zeal and affection to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of my Countrey, and not at all with the leaſt intention to favour or promote the Cauſe or Intereſt of the D. of <hi>York,</hi> or to diſparage the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> from whom I never received the leaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs, nor ever had the honour to be in his Company; and to whom I ſhall ever pay reſpect ſuitable to his high Birth and Merit.</p>

                  <p>I ſee I muſt obey you, but pray help me, and tell me in the firſt place, whether you do not both believe, that as the <hi>cauſa cauſarum</hi> of all our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions is (as has been proved) the breach of our Government; ſo that the immediate Cauſes are two: Firſt, The great diſtruſt on both ſides between the King and his People and Parliament; the firſt fearing that his Power will be ſo leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened by degrees, that at length it will not be able to keep the Crown upon his head: And the latter ſeeing all things in diſorder, and that the Laws are not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted (which is the ſecond of the two Cauſes) fear the King intends to change the Government, and be Arbitrary.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Noble Ven.</speaker>
                  <p>I am a Stranger, but (though I never reflected ſo much upon the Original Cauſe, as I have done ſince I heard you diſcourſe of it) yet I ever thought that thoſe two were the Cauſes of the Unquietneſs of this Kingdom: I mean the Jealouſie between the King and his People, and the Inexecution of the great Laws of Calling Parliaments An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, and letting them ſit to diſpatch their Affairs: I underſtand this in the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:107138:117"/>time of His Majeſties Grand-Father, and Father, more than in His own Reign.</p>

                  <p>Then whoever can abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lay theſe two Cauſes aſleep for ever, will arrive to a perfect Cure; which I conceive no way of doing, but that the King have a great deal more Power or a great deal leſs: And you know that what goes out of the King muſt go into the People, and ſo
<hi>vice verſa:</hi> Inſomuch that the People muſt have a great deal more Power, or a great deal leſs: Now it is no queſtion, but either of theſe two, would rather increaſe their Power than dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it; ſo that if this cannot be made up by the Wiſdom of this Age, we may ſee in the next, that both the King will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be altogether without a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Parliament to be without a King.</p>

                  <p>No, I abhor the thoughts of wiſhing, much leſs endeavouring any ſuch thing, during theſe Circumſtances we are now in; That is, under Oaths of <pb n="228" facs="tcp:107138:118"/>Obedience to a Lawful King. And truly if any <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> ſhould make to me ſuch a Propoſal, I ſhould give the ſame Judgment concerning it, that <hi>Ariſtides</hi> did in ſuch a Caſe. The Story is ſhort; After the War between the
<hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Perſians</hi> was ended, and <hi>Xerxes</hi> driven out of <hi>Greece,</hi> the whole Fleet of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Confederates (except that of <hi>Athens</hi> which was gone home) lay in a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenal (ſuch as were then in uſe) upon the Coaſt of
<hi>Attica;</hi> during their abode there, <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> harrangues one day the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Athens</hi> (as was then the Cuſtome) and tells them, that he had a deſign in his head, which would be of Infinite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and advantage to the Commonwealth; But that it could not be executed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Order and Authority of them, and that it did likewiſe require ſecreſie; and if it were declared there in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place, where Strangers as well as Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens might be preſent, it could not be concealed, and therefore propoſed it to their conſideration what ſhould be done in it: it was at length concluded that <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles</hi> ſhould propoſe it to <hi>Ariſtides,</hi> and if he did next morning acquaint the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:107138:118"/>that he gave his approbation to it, it ſhould be proceeded in: <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms him that the whole Fleet of their Confederates in the War againſt the <hi>Medes</hi> had betaken themſelves to the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenal upon their Coaſt, where they might be eaſily fired, and then the <hi>Athenians</hi> would remain abſolute Maſters of the Sea, and ſo give Law to all <hi>Greece;</hi> when
<hi>Ariſtides</hi> came the next day to deliver his Judgment to the People, he told them that the buſineſs propoſed by <hi>Themiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> was indeed very advantageous, and profitable to the <hi>Athenians;</hi> But withal, the moſt Wicked and Villanous Attempt that ever was undertaken; upon which it was wholly laid aſide. And the ſame Judgment do I give, <hi>Doctor,</hi> of your <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocracy</hi> at this time. But to return to the place where I was, I do belive that this difference may eaſily be terminated very fairly, and that our Houſe need not be pulled down, and a new one built; but may be very eaſily repair'd, ſo that it may laſt many hundred years.</p>

                  <p>I begin to perceive that you aim at this, That the King muſt give the People more Power, as <hi>Henry</hi> the <pb n="230" facs="tcp:107138:119"/>Third, and King <hi>John</hi> did, or the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt give the King more, as you ſaid they did in <hi>France</hi> in the time of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh; or elſe that it will come in time to a War again.</p>

                  <p>You may pleaſe to know, that in all times hitherto, the Parliament never demanded any thing of the King, wherein the Intereſt and Government of the Kingdom was concerned (excepting Acts of Pardon) but they founded their demands upon their Right, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it might ſeem unreaſonable for them to be earneſt with him to give them that which was his own, but alſo becauſe they cannot chuſe but know, that all Powers which are Fundamentally and Lawfully in the Crown, were placed there upon the firſt Inſtitution of our Government, to capacitate the Prince to Govern and Protect his People: So that for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to ſeek to take from him ſuch Authority, were to be <hi>felo de ſe,</hi> as we call a ſelf-Homicide; but as in ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of the Body the Head ſuffers as well as the Inferiour parts, ſo that it is not poſſible for it, to order, direct and provide for the whole Body as its Office
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:107138:119"/>requires, ſince the Wiſdom and Power which is placed there, is given by God to that end; In which Caſe, though the Diſtemper of the Body may begin from the Diſeaſe of ſome other part, or from the maſs of Blood, or putrefaction of other Humours; yet ſince that noble part is ſo affected by it, that Reaſon and Diſcourſe fails, therefore to reſtore this again, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies muſt be apply'd to, and poſſibly Humours or Vapours drawn from the Head it ſelf, that ſo it may be able to Govern and Reign over the Body as it did before, or elſe the whole Man, like a Slave, muſt be ruled and guided <hi>ab extrinſeco,</hi> that is by ſome Keeper: So it is now with us, in our Politick Diſeaſe, where granting (if you pleaſe) that the Diſtemper does not proceed from the Head, but the Corruption of other parts, yet in the Cure, Applications muſt be made to the Head as well as to the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, if we mean poor <hi>England</hi> ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its former perfect health; and there fore it will be found, perhaps, Eſſential to our being, to ask ſomething (in the condition we now are) to which the King as yet may have a Right; and which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept <pb n="232" facs="tcp:107138:120"/>he pleaſe to part with, the <hi>Phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> of Government cannot be ſalved; That is, our Laws cannot be executed; nor <hi>Magna Charta</hi> it ſelf made practicable; and ſo both Prince and People, that is, the Polity of <hi>England,</hi> muſt die of this Diſeaſe, or by this
<hi>Delirium</hi> muſt be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, <hi>ab extrinſeco,</hi> and fall to the Lot of ſome Foregin Power.</p>

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:107138:120"/>and Diſorder; It is not like to mend Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for them to give him more, except they will deliver up to him at the ſame inſtant their Poſſeſſions, and Right to their Lands, and become Naturally and Politically his Slaves.</p>

Barnardino da <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dine,</hi> and was eſteemed a very holy Man, as well as an excellent Preacher, inſomuch that he was appointed to Preach the <hi>Lent</hi> Sermons in one of our principal Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which he performed at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſo much Eloquence, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, that the Church was daily croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed three hours before the Sermon was to begin; the eſteem and veneration this poor Fryar was in, elevated his Spirit a little too high to be contained within the bounds of reaſon; but before his
<hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium</hi> was perceived, he told his Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one day, that the true Devotion of that People, and the care they had to come to hear his word Preached, had <pb n="234" facs="tcp:107138:121"/>been ſo acceptable to God and to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that they had vouchſafed to Inſpire him with the knowledg of an Expedient, which he did not doubt, but would make Men happy &amp; juſt even in this Life, &amp; that the Fleſh ſhould no longer luſt againſt the Spirit; but that he would not acquaint them with it at that preſent, becauſe ſomething was to be done on their parts to make them capable of this great Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, which was to pray zealouſly for a happy Succeſs upon his Endeavours, and to Faſt, and to viſit the Churches to that end; therefore he deſired them to come the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> following to be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this bleſſed Expedient. You may Imagine how deſirous our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were, to hear ſomething more of this Fifth-Monarchy; I will ſhorten my Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and tell you nothing of what croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was all night, and what quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling for places in the Church; nor with what difficulty the <hi>Saffi,</hi> who were ſent by the Magiſtrate to keep the Paece, and to make way for the Preacher to get into the Pulpit, did both; But up he got, and after a long preamable of deſiring more Prayers, and Addreſſing himſelf to our <pb n="235" facs="tcp:107138:121"/>Senate to Mediate with the Pope, that a week might be ſet apart for a Jubilee and Faſting three days all over the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an World, to ſtorm Heaven with Maſſes, Prayers, Faſting and Almes to proſper his Deſigns; he began to open the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, That the Cauſe of all the Wickedneſs and Sin, and by Conſequence of all the Miſeries and Affliction which is in the World, ariſing from the enmity which is between God and the Devil, by which means God was often croſs'd in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of good to Mankind here, and hereafter, the Devil by his temptations making us uncapable of the Mercy and Favour of our Creator; therefore he had a Deſign (with the helps before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) to mediate with Almighty God, That he would pardon the Devil, and receive him into his Favour again after ſo long a time of Baniſhment and Impriſonment; and not to take all his power from him, but to leave him ſo much as might do good to Man, and not hurt; which he doubted not but he would imploy that way, after ſuch reconciliation was made, which his Faith would not let him que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. You may judge what the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <pb n="236" facs="tcp:107138:122"/>Auditory thought of this; I can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell you, that he had a different ſort of Company at his return, from what he had when he came, for the Men left him to the Boys, who with great Hoops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Acclamations, brought him to the
<hi>Gondola,</hi> which conveyed him to the <hi>Redentor,</hi> where he lodged; And I never had the curioſity to enquire what became of him after.</p>

                  <p>There cannot, nor ought to be, any Change, but by his Majeſty's free Conſent; for beſides, that a War is to be abhorred by all Men that love their Country, any Conteſt of that kind in this caſe (<hi>viz.</hi> to take away the leaſt part of the Kings Right) could be juſtified by no man living. I ſay, beſides that, a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War has miſcarried in our days, which was founded (at leaſt pretendedly) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Defence of the People's own Rights: In which, although they had as clear a Victory in the end, as ever any Conteſt upon Earth had, yet could they never reap the leaſt advantage in the World by it: but went from one Tyranny to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from <hi>Barebones</hi> Parliament, to <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Reign; from that, to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Safety; leaving thoſe Grave
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:107138:123"/>Men, who managed Affairs at the begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning, amazed to ſee new Men, and new Principles Governing <hi>England.</hi> And this induced them to Co-operate to bring things back juſt where they were before the War. Therefore this Remedy will be either none, or worſe than the Diſeaſe: It not being now as it was in the Barons time, when the Lord who led out his Men, could bring them back again when he pleaſed, and Rule them in the mean time, being his Vaſſals. But now there is no Man of ſo much Credit, but that one who behaves himſelf bravely in the War, ſhall out-vye him; and, poſſibly, be able to do what he pleaſes with the Army and the Government: And in this corrupt Age, it is ten to one, he will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do Hurt than Good with the Power he acquires. But becauſe you ask me how we would perſwade the King to this? I anſwer, by the Parliament's humbly Remonſtrating to His Majeſty, that it is his own Intereſt, Preſervation, Quiet and true Greatneſs, to put an end to the Diſtractions of his Subjects, and that it cannot be done any other way, and to deſire him to enter into debate with ſome <pb n="239" facs="tcp:107138:123"/>Men Authorized by them, to ſee if there can be any other means than what they ſhall offer to compoſe things; if they find there may, then to embrace it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to inſiſt upon their own Propoſals: and if in the end they cannot obtain thoſe Requeſts, which they think the only eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential means to preſerve their Country, then to beg their Diſmiſſion, that they may not ſtay, and be partakers in the Ruin of it. Now, my Reaſons why the King will pleaſe to grant this, after the thorough diſcuſſing of it, are two. Firſt, Becauſe all great Princes have ever made up Matters with their Subjects upon ſuch Conteſts, without coming to Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The two greateſt, and moſt Valiant of our Princes, were <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, and his Grandchild <hi>Edward</hi> the Third: theſe had very great Demands made them by Parliaments, and granted them all; as you may ſee upon the Statute-Book. <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, on the contrary, refuſed all things till they were brought to Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. There is a Memorable Example in the Greek Story of <hi>Theopompus</hi> King of <hi>Sparta;</hi> whoſe Subjects finding the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <pb n="240" facs="tcp:107138:124"/>in diſorder for want of ſome Perſons that might be a Check upon the great Power of the King, propoſed to him the Creation of the <hi>Ephores</hi> (Officers who made that City ſo great and Famous afterwards). The King finding by their Reaſons (which were unanſwerable, as I think ours now are), that the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of
<hi>Sparta</hi> was near its Ruin, without ſuch a Cure; and conſidering that he had more to loſe in that Diſorder than others, freely granted their deſires; for which being derided by his Wife, who asked him what a kind of Monarchy he would leave to his Son? anſwered, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good one, becauſe it will be a very laſting one. Which brings on my Second Reaſon, for which I believe the King will grant theſe things; becauſe he cannot any way mend himſelf, nor his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he do not.</p>

                  <p>You have very fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me of two things: Firſt, That we have no reaſon to expect or believe that the Parliament will ever increaſe the Kings Power: And then, that the King cannot by any way found himſelf a New, and more abſolute Monarchy, except he <pb n="241" facs="tcp:107138:124"/>can al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>er the Condition of Property, which I think we may take for granted to be impoſſible. But yet, I know not why we may not ſuppoſe that (although he cannot eſtabliſh to all Poſterity ſuch an Empire) he may, notwithſtanding, change the Government at the preſent; and calling Parliaments no more, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter it by force, as it is done in <hi>France,</hi> for ſome good time.</p>

                  <p>In <hi>France</hi> it has been a long Work; and although that Tyranny was begun, as has been ſaid, by Petition from the States themſelves, not to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled any more; yet the Kings ſince, in time of great Diſtraction, have thought fit to convocate them again; as they did in the Civil Wars thrice: Once at <hi>Orle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and twice at
<hi>Blois.</hi> I would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat what I have ſo tediouſly diſcourſed of concerning <hi>France</hi> already, but only to intreat you to remember that our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has no ſuch poor and numerous Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whlch draw better Revenues from the King's Purſe, than they can from their own Eſtates; all our country people con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Rich Nobility and Gentry, of Wealthy Yeomen, and of Poor Younger <pb n="242" facs="tcp:107138:125"/>Brothers who have little or nothing, and can never raiſe their Companies, if they ſhould get Commiſſions, without their Elder Brothers Aſſiſtance amongſt his Tenants, or elſe with the free conſent and deſire of the People, which, in this caſe, would hardly be afforded them. But we will ſuppoſe there be idle People enough to make an Army, and that the King has Money enough to Arm and Raiſe them: And I will grant too, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void tediouſneſs (although I do not think it poſſible) that the people will at the firſt, for fear, receive them into their Houſes, and Quarter them againſt. Law; nay, pay the Money which ſhall be by Illegal Edicts, impoſed upon the Subjects to pay them; Yet is it poſſible an Army can continue any time to enſlave their own Country? Can they reſiſt the Prayers, or the Curſes of their Fathers, Brothers, Wives, Mothers, Siſters, and of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wherever they frequent? Upon this Account all the <hi>Greek</hi> Tyrants were of very ſhort Continuance; who being in chief Magiſtracy and Credit in their Commonwealths, by means of Soldiers and <hi>Satellites,</hi> uſurped the Soveraignty.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:107138:125"/>But did ever any of them, excepting
<hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius,</hi> leave it to his Son? Who was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out within leſs than a year after his Fathers death. Many Armies of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives have deſtroyed Tyrannies: So the <hi>Decemvirate</hi> was ruined at <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins</hi> expelled before that: Our own Country has been a Stage, even in our time, where this Tragedy has been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently acted; for the Army, after the War was done, fearing the Monarchy ſhould be reſtored again, held Councils, got Agitators; and though there were often very ſevere Executions upon the Ring-leaders, did at length, by their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, neceſſitate their Officers to joyn with them (having many good Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces of the Party to adviſe them); and ſo broke all Treaties. And the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too, adhering to a ſmall Party of them who conſented to lay aſide Kingly Government, and afterwards drove them away too, fearing they would continue to Govern in Oligarchy. I am far from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving this way they uſed, in which they broke all Laws, Divine and Humane, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical and Moral: But I urge it only to ſhew how eaſily an Army of Natives is
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:107138:126"/>to be deluded with the Name of Liberty, and brought to pull down any thing which their Ring-leaders tell them tends to enſlaving their Country. 'Tis true, this Army was afterwards cheated by their General; who without their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, much leſs Conſent, one Morning, ſuddenly made himſelf Tyrant of his Country. It as true, that their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (not their Arms) ſupported him in that State for ſome time; but it is certain that they did very often, and to the laſt, refuſe to be inſtrumental to levy Moneys, though for their own pay: and ſo he, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Will, was fain to call from time to time Parliamentary Conventions. And it is moſt certain that he did, in the Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which he died, often complain that his Army would not go a ſtep farther with him: and, <hi>de facto,</hi> ſome Months after his death, they did dethrone his Son, and reſtore the Remainder of the old Parliament, upon promiſe made to them in ſecret (by the Demogogues of that Aſſembly) that a Commonwealth ſhould be ſpeedily framed and ſetled.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I am ſatisfied that an Army raiſed here on a ſudden, and which never <pb n="245" facs="tcp:107138:126"/>ſaw an Enemy, could not be brought to act ſuch high things for the Ruin of their own Government; nor poſſibly, would be any way able to reſiſt the Fury and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the people. But what ſay you of a Forreign Army, raiſed by your King abroad, and brought over, whoſe Officers and Soldiers ſhall have no Acquaintance or Relations amongſt the people here?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eng. Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>All Forces of that kind muſt be either Auxiliaries or Mercenaries: Auxiliaries are ſuch as are ſent by ſome Neighbour Prince or State, with their own Colours, and paid by themſelves: though poſſibly, the Prince who demands them may furniſh the Money. Theſe uſually return home again, when the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, for which they were demanded, is over: But whether they do or not, if they be not mixed and over-ballanced with Forces which depend upon the Prince who calls them, but that the whole Weight and power lies in them, they will certainly, firſt or laſt, ſeize that Country for their own Soveraign. And as for Mercenaries, they muſt be raiſed ('tis true) with the Money of the Prince who needs them, but by the Authority and <pb n="246" facs="tcp:107138:127"/>Credit of ſome Great Perſons who are to Lead and Command them: And theſe, in all Occaſions, have made their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander Prince; as <hi>F. Sforza</hi> at <hi>Milan</hi> drove out by this trick the <hi>Viſconti,</hi> ancient Dukes of that State; and the
<hi>Mamalukes</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> made themſelves a Military Commonwealth. So that the way of an Army here would either be no Remedy at all, or one very much worſe than the Diſeaſe to the Prince himſelf.</p>

                  <p>Well Sir, I begin to be of Opinion, that any thing the King can grant the Parliament (eſpecially ſuch a Parliament as this is, which conſiſts of Men of very great Eſtates, and ſo can have no intereſt to deſire Troubles) will not be ſo inconvenient to him, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to break the Government by force. But why may he not, for this time, by ſoothing them, and offering them great Alliances abroad for the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of
<hi>England,</hi> and ballancing Matters in <hi>Europe</hi> more eaven than they have been; and, in fine, by offering them a War with the <hi>French,</hi> to which Nation they have ſo great a hatred; lay them aſleep, and get good ſtore of Money, and <pb n="247" facs="tcp:107138:127"/>ſtave off this ſevere Cure you ſpeak of, at leaſt, for ſome time longer?</p>

                  <p>There has been ſomething of this done too lately; and there is a Gentleman lies in the Tower, who is to anſwer for it. But you may pleaſe to underſtand, that there is ſcarce any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the middle ſort of People, much leſs within the Walls of the Houſe of Commons, who do not perfectly know, that we can have no Alliance with any Nation in the World that will ſignifie any thing to them, or to our ſelves, till our Government be redreſſed and new model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. And therefore, though there were an Army Landed in this Iſland, yet that we muſt begin there, before we are fit to repulſe them, or defend our ſelves. And the fear and ſenſe of this People uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally is, that if we ſhould have any War, either for our own Concerns, or for thoſe of our Allies, whilſt Matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as they do at home, it would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly come to this paſs, that either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten, we ſhould ſubject this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to an Invaſion, at a time when we are in a very ill condition to repell it; or elſe, if we were Victorious, that our
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:107138:128"/>Courtiers and Counſellors <hi>in fragrante</hi> (or as the <hi>French</hi> cry, <hi>d'emble</hi>), would employ that Mettle and good Fortune to try ſome ſuch Concluſions at home as we have been diſcourſing of. And therefore, if any War ſhould be undertaken without Parliament, you ſhould ſee the People rejoyce as much at any diſaſter our Forces ſhould receive, as they did when the <hi>Scots</hi> ſeized the four Northern Counties in 1639. Or before that, when we were beaten at the Iſle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> or when we had any Loſs in the laſt War with
<hi>Holland.</hi> And this Joy is not ſo unnatural as it may ſeem to thoſe who do not conſider the Cauſe of it; which is the breach of our old Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the neceſſity our Governors are under to make ſome new experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And the fear we are in, that any Proſperity may make them able to try them, either with Effect, or at leaſt with Impunity. Which Conſideration made a Court-Droll ſay lately to His Majeſty, (who ſeemed to wonder why his ſubjects hated the <hi>French</hi> ſo much); Sir, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you love them, and eſpouſe their Intereſt: And if you would diſcover this Truth clearly, you may pleaſe to make <pb n="249" facs="tcp:107138:128"/>War with the King of <hi>France;</hi> and then you ſhall ſee, that this People will not only love them, take their parts, and wiſh them Succeſs; but will exceedingly rejoyce when they are Victorious in ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Ships, or defeating your Forces. And this is ſufficient to anſwer your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal for Alliances abroad, and for a War with <hi>France.</hi> Beſides this (to wind all up in a Word) it is not to be imagined, that ſo good and wiſe a Prince as we have at this time ſhould ever be induced (when he comes to underſtand perfectly his own Condition) to let his own Intereſt (grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Power to be ſo, which is very falſe) conteſt with the Safety and Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his People, for which only it was given him; or that he will be any way tenacious of ſuch Prerogatives, as now, by a natural Revolution of Political Circumſtances, are ſo far from continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſeful to his Governing the People, that they are the only <hi>Remora</hi> and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle of all Government, Settlement and Order. For His Majeſty muſt needs know, that all Forms of regulating Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind under Laws were ordained by God and Man, for the Happineſs and Security of <pb n="250" facs="tcp:107138:129"/>the Governed, and not for the Intereſt and Greatneſs of thoſe who rule; unleſs where there is <hi>Melior Natura</hi> in the Caſe. So God Governs Man for his own Glory only, and Men Reign over Beaſts for their own Uſe and Service; and where an Abſolute Prince rules over his own Servants whom he feeds and pays (as we have ſaid), or the Maſter of a great and numerous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Governs his Houſhold; they are both bound by the Law of God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by their own Intereſt, to do them Juſtice, and not
<hi>Inſaevire</hi> or Tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over them, more than the neceſſity of preſerving their Empire and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty requires.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, the Council, that is, the Privy Council which you mean, is no part of our Government, as we may have occaſion to ſhew hereafter; nor is the King obliged by any Fundamental Law, or by any Act of Parliament to hearken to their Advice, or ſo much as to ask it; and if you ſhould make one on purpoſe, beſides that it would not be ſo effectual as what we may propoſe, it would be full as hard to go down either with King or Parliament. But beſides all this, you would ſee ſome of theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours ſo nominated by Parliament, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps prove honeſt, and then they would be forced to withdraw as ſome lately did, becauſe they found, I ſuppoſe, that till the Adminiſtration be alter'd, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that their Councils can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, or any thing be acted by them which may tend to the good of their Country; thoſe who have not ſo great a ſence of Honour and Integrity, will be preſently corrupted by their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, whilſt the Prince is left in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all thoſe baits and means to anſwer <pb n="252" facs="tcp:107138:130"/>ſuch Mens ectpectations: It being moſt certain, that if you have a muſty Veſſel, and by conſequence diſlike the Beer which comes out of it, and draw it out, cauſing the Barrel to be immediately fill'd with good and ſound Liquor, it is certain by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that both your new Drink, and all that ever you ſhall put into the Cask, till it be taken in pieces, and the Pipes ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and new model'd, will be full as muſty, and unſavoury as the firſt which you found fault with.</p>

                  <p>Now, Sir, I think we are at an end of our Queſtions, and I for my part am convinced, that as the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better himſelf any way by falling out with his people at this time, ſo that his goodneſs and wiſdom is ſuch, that he will rather chuſe to imitate the moſt glorious and generous of his predeceſſors, as <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Firſt, and
<hi>Edward</hi> the Third, than thoſe who were of leſs worth, and more unfortunate, as <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second. And therefore we are now ready to hear what you would think fit to ask of ſo excellent a Prince.</p>

                  <p>I never undertook to be ſo <pb n="253" facs="tcp:107138:130"/>preſumptuous; there is a Parliament to ſit ſpeedily, and certainly they are the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt every way to ſearch into ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and to anticipate their wiſdom would be unreaſonable, and might give them juſt offence. But becauſe all this tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle tattle may not go for nothing, I ſhall preſume to give you my thoughts, how the Cure muſt be wrought, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to particulars. The Cauſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate (as we have ſaid) of our Diſeaſe, is the inexecution of our Laws; and it is moſt true, that when that is alter'd for the better, and that all our Laws are duly executed, we are in health; for as we can never have the entire benefit of them, till our Government is upon a right Baſis; ſo whenever we enjoy this happineſs, to have the full benefit of thoſe Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which were made by our Anceſtors for our ſafe and orderly living, our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is upon a right Baſis; therefore we muſt enquire into the Cauſe why our Laws are not executed, &amp; when you have found and taken away that Cauſe, all is well. The Cauſe can be no other than this, That the King is told, and does believe, that moſt of theſe great Charters <pb n="254" facs="tcp:107138:131"/>or Rights of the people, of which we now chiefly treat, are againſt his Majeſties In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, though this be very falſe (as has been ſaid) yet we will not diſpute it at this time, but take it for granted, ſo that the King having the Supreme execution of the Laws in his hand, cannot be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſuppoſed to be willing to execute them whenever he can chuſe whether he will do it or no; it being natural for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man not to do any thing againſt his own Intereſt when he can help it; now when you have thought well what it ſhould be that gives the King a Liberty to chuſe whether any part of the Law ſhall be currant or no, you will find that it is the great Power the King enjoys in the Government; when the Parliament hath diſcovered this, they will no doubt demand of his Majeſty an abatement of his Royal Prerogative in thoſe matters only which concern our enjoyment of our All, that is our Lives, Liberties and Eſtates, and leave his Royal Power entire and untoucht in all the other branches of it; when this is done, we ſhall be as if ſome great Heroe had performed the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture of diſſolving the Inchantment
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:107138:131"/>we have been under ſo many years. And all our Statutes from the higheſt to the loweſt, from <hi>Magna Charta</hi> to that for burying in Woollen, will be current, and we ſhall neither fear the bringing in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, nor Arbitrary Power in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of Parliament, neither will there be any Diſſentions in them; all Cauſes of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions between the Country and Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>party being entirely aboliſht; ſo that the People ſhall have no reaſon to diſtruſt their Prince, nor he them.</p>

                  <p>You make us a fine Golden Age; but after all this, will you not be pleaſed to ſhew us a ſmall proſpect of this <hi>Canaan,</hi> or Country of reſt; will you not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to particularize a little what Powers there are in the King, which you would have diſcontinued? would you have ſuch Prerogatives aboliſhed, or placed elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where?</p>

                  <p>There can be no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if they be aboliſhed. But I will not be like a Man who refuſes to ſing amongſt his Friends at their entreaty, becauſe he has an ill Voice; I will rather ſuffer my ſelf to be laught at by you in delivering my ſmall Judgment in this Matter, but
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:107138:132"/>ſtill with this proteſtation, that I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that an Infinity of Men better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifi'd than my ſelf for ſuch ſublime Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and much more the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, who repreſent the Wiſdom as well as the Power of this Kingdom, may find out a far better way, than my poor parts and Capacity can ſuggeſt. The powers then which now being in the Crown do hinder the execution of our Laws, and prevent by conſequence our happineſs and ſettlement, are four; The abſolute power of making War and peace, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Alliances with all Nations in the World, by which means, by Ignorant Councellours, or Wicked Miniſters, many of our former Kings have made Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Wars, very contrary, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> and by the unfortunate management of them, have often put the Kingdom in great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of Invaſion: Beſides that, as long as there is a diſtinction made between the Court-party and that of the Country, there will ever be a Jealouſie in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that thoſe wicked Councellours (who may think they can be ſafe no other way) will make Alliances with powerful Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <pb n="257" facs="tcp:107138:132"/>in which there may be a ſecret Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle by which thoſe Princes ſhall ſtipulate to aſſiſt them with Forces upon a ſhort warning to curb the Parliament, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly to change the Government. And this apprehenſion in the People will be the leſs unreaſonable, becauſe <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> (the great Pattern of ſome of our Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers) is notoriouſly known to have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted an Article in his Treaty with Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Mazzarin,</hi> during this King of
<hi>France</hi>'s Minority, That he ſhould be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted with ten thouſand Men from <hi>France</hi> upon occaſion to preſerve and defend him in his Uſurped Government, againſt His Majeſty that now is, or the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or in fine, his own Army, whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt he often feared. The Second great Prerogative the King enjoys, is the ſole Diſpoſal and Ordering of the Militia by Sea and Land, Raiſing Forces, Gariſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Fortifying places, Setting out Ships of War, ſo far as he can do all this without putting Taxations upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and this not only in the Intervals of Parliament, but even during their Seſſion; ſo that they cannot raiſe the Train-bands <pb n="258" facs="tcp:107138:133"/>of the Country or City to Guard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or ſecure the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The third point is, That it is in His Majeſties Power to Nominate and Appoint as he pleaſes, and for what time he thinks fit, all the Officers of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that are of Truſt or profit, both Civil, Military, and Eccleſiaſtical, (as they will be called) except where there is <hi>Jus Patronatus;</hi> Theſe two laſt Powers may furniſh a Prince who will hearken to ill deſigning Councellours, with the means either of Invading the Government by Force, or by his Judges and other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures undermining it by Fraud; Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by enjoying the Fourth Advantage, which is the Laying out and Imploying, as he pleaſes, all the Publick Revenues of the Crown or Kingdom, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any regard (except he thinks fit) to the neceſſity of the Navy, or any other thing that concerns the Safety of the Publick. So that all theſe Four great Powers, as things now ſtand, may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operated at any time, as well to deſtroy and ruine the good Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the State, as to preſerve and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <pb n="259" facs="tcp:107138:133"/>it, as they ought to do.</p>

                  <p>But if you diveſt the King of theſe Powers, will you have the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſit always to Govern theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?</p>

                  <p>Sir, I would not diveſt the King of them, much leſs would I have the Parliament aſſume them, or perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate their Sitting: They are a Body more fitted to make Laws, and puniſh the Breakers of them, than to execute them. I would have them therefore petition His Majeſty by way of Bill, that he will pleaſe to exerciſe theſe four great <hi>Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> of Government, with the Conſent of four ſeveral Councils to be appointed for that end, and not otherwiſe; that is, with the Conſent of the Major part of them, if any of them diſſent. In all which Councils His Majeſty, or who he pleaſes to appoint, ſhall preſide; the Councils to be named in Parliament; firſt all the number, and every Year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a third part: So each Year a third part ſhall go out, and a Recruit of an equal number come in: And in three Years they ſhall be all new, and no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:107138:134"/>to come into that Council, or any other of the four, till he have kept out of any of them full three Years, being as long as he was in. And this I learnt from your <hi>Quarantia's</hi> at <hi>Venice:</hi> and the Uſe is excellent; for being in ſuch a Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſure to have their intervals of Power, they will neither grow ſo inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as to brave their King, nor will the Prince have any occaſion to corrupt them, although he had the means to do it, which in this new Model he cannot have. Theſe Men in their ſeveral Councils ſhould have no other inſtructions, but to diſpoſe of all things, and act in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Charges, for the Intereſt and Glory of <hi>England;</hi> and ſhall be Anſwerable to Parliament, from time to time, for any malicious or adviſed Miſdemeanor: only that Council which manages the Publick Revenue, ſhall (beſides a very copious and Honourable Revenue which ſhall be left to His Majeſty's diſpoſal for his own Entertainment, as belongs to the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and Majeſty of the Government) have Inſtructions to ſerve His Majeſty (if he pleaſes to command them, and not <pb n="261" facs="tcp:107138:134"/>otherwiſe) in the regulating and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Oeconomy and Houſhold; and if they ſhall ſee it neceſſary, for extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Occaſions of treating Foreign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Ambaſſadors, or Preſenting them, and the like Oſtentation of Greatneſs; to conſent with His Majeſty moderately to charge the Revenue to that end. I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe that this Expedient is much more effectual than either the <hi>Juſtitia</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> was, or the <hi>Ephores</hi> of <hi>Sparta:</hi> Who being to check the King almoſt in every thing, without having any ſhare in his Councils, or underſtanding them, could not chuſe but make a ſullen poſture of Affairs; whereas theſe both ſeem, and really are the King's Miniſters, only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by Parliament to act faithfully and honeſtly; to which, even without that, all other Councellors are bound by Oath. As for the other Council, now called the Privy Council, the King may ſtill pleaſe to continue to nominate them at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo they act nothing in any of the Matters properly within the Juriſdiction of theſe four Councils, but meddle with the Affairs of Merchants, Plantations,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:107138:135"/>Charters, and other Matters, to which the Regal Power extendeth. And provided that His Majeſty call none of the Perſons employed in theſe other four Councils during their being ſo, nor that this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil do any way intermeddle with any Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, Criminal or Civil, which are to be decided by Law, and do belong to the Juriſdictions of other Courts or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, they being no eſtabliſhed Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory, or Congregation, which either our Government or Laws do take notice of (as was ſaid before) but Perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated by the King, as his Friends and faithful Subjects, to give him their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Execution of his Regal Office. As for Example, the King does exerciſe, at this time, a Negative Voice as to Bills preſented to him by the Parliament, which he claims by Right; no Man ever ſaid that the Privy Council had a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Voice; yet former Kings did not only ask their Advice as to the paſſing or not paſſing of ſuch Bills, but often decided the Matter by their Votes; which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be a high Preſumption in them, when they venture to give him Council
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:107138:135"/>contrary to what is given him by his grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Council, yet never any of them have been queſtioned for it; being looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as private Men, who ſpeak according to the beſt of their Cunning, and ſuch as have no publick Capacity at all. But if this be not ſo, and that this Council have ſome Foundation in Law, and ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Capacity, I wiſh in this new Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it may be made otherwiſe, and that His Majeſty pleaſe to take their Counſel in private; but ſummon no Perſons to appear before them; much leſs give them Authority to ſend for in Cuſtody, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon any Subject, which may as well be done by the Judges and Magiſtrates; who, if Secrecy be required, may as well be Sworn to Secrecy as theſe Gentlemen; and I believe can keep Counſel as well, and give it too.</p>

                  <p>But would you have none to manage State-Affairs, none Impriſoned for ſecret Conſpiracies, and kept till they can be fully diſcovered? you have made an Act here lately about Impriſonments, that every Perſon ſhall have his <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> I think you call it: ſo that no <pb n="264" facs="tcp:107138:136"/>Man, for what occaſion ſoever, can lie in Priſon above a Night, but the Cauſe muſt be revealed, though there be great cauſe for the concealing it.</p>

                  <p>This Act you mention, and a great many more which we have to the ſame purpoſe, that is, againſt Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Impriſonments, ſhews that for a long time the Power over Men's Perſons has been exerciſed (under His Majeſty) by ſuch as were very likely, rather to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it ill than well; (that is) would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Impriſon ten Men for Honourable Actions; ſuch as ſtanding for the People's Rights in Parliament, refuſing to pay Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal Taxes, and the like; than one for projecting and inventing Illegal Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies, or any other kind of oppreſſing the People. This made firſt <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> then the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> and divers other Acts beſides this laſt, take that Power quite away, and make the Law and the Judges the only Diſpoſers of the Liberties of our Perſons. And it may be, when the Parliament ſhall ſee the Fruit of this Alteration we are now diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of, and that State-Affairs are in bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:107138:136"/>hands, they may think fit to provide that a Return, or Warrant of Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from one of theſe Four Councils (which I ſuppoſe will have a Power of Commitment given them, as to Perſons appearing Delinquents before them) wherein it ſhall be expreſſed, That if the Publick is like to ſuffer or be defrauded, if the Matter be immediately divulged; I ſay in this Caſe, the Parliament may pleaſe to make it Lawful for the Judge to delay the Bailing of him for ſome ſmall time, becauſe it is not to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that theſe Councellours ſo choſen, and ſo inſtructed, and to continue ſo ſmall a time, will uſe this Power ill; eſpecially being accountable for any abuſing of it to the next Parliament. And I ſuppoſe the Parliament, amongſt other Proviſions in this behalf, will require that there ſhall be a Regiſter kept of all the Votes of theſe ſeveral Councils, with the names as well of thoſe who conſented, as of ſuch who diſſented: And as to the former part of your Queſtion, whether I would have none to manage State Affairs; I think there are very few State Affairs <pb n="266" facs="tcp:107138:137"/>that do not concern either Peace and War, and Treaties abroad, the management of the Arms, Militia, and <hi>poſſe Comita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> at home; the management of all the Publick Moneys, and the Election of all Officers whatſoever; the other parts, of State Affairs, which are Making and Repealing of Laws, puniſhing high Crimes againſt the State, with Levying and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioning all manner of Impoſitions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the People, this is reſerved to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament it ſelf; and the Execution of all Laws to the Judges, and Magiſtrates; And I can think of no other Affairs of State than theſe.</p>

                  <p>I have thought that the <hi>Ephores</hi> of <hi>Sparta</hi> were an admirable Magiſtracy, not only for the Intereſt of the People, but likewiſe for the preſervation of the authority of the Kings, and of their lives too; for <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of
<hi>Meſene</hi> and <hi>Argos</hi> had the ſame Government with
<hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and yet for want of erecting ſuch an Authority as was in the <hi>Ephores,</hi> they were not only perpetually in brolls amongſt themſelves, and for that reaſon ever beaten by their Enemies, whereas the
<hi>Spartans</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways victorious, but even their Kings were the moſt miſerable of Men, being often call'd in queſtion Judicially, and ſo loſt their Lives, and many of them mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by Inſurrections of the People: <pb n="268" facs="tcp:107138:138"/>And at laſt in both theſe Cities, the Kings were driven out, their Families extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Territory new divided, and the Government turn'd into a <hi>Democracy.</hi> And I ever thought that this expedient you propoſe (for I have heard you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of it often before now) would prove a more ſafe, and a more noble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation than the Inſtitution of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phores</hi> was, and that a Prince who is a lover of his Country, who is Gracious, Wiſe and Juſt, (ſuch a one as it has pleaſed God to ſend us at this time) ſhall be ten times more abſolute when this Regulation is made, than ever he was or could be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and that whatſoever he propoſes in any of theſe Councils will be received as a Law, nay, as an Oracle: And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, ill and weak Princes ſhall have no poſſibility of corrupting Men, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either themſelves or their People any kind of harm or miſchief: But have you done now?</p>

                  <p>No, Sir, when this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is made for the Execution of the Laws, (which I think very effectual, not to ſay Infallible) although it is not to be <pb n="269" facs="tcp:107138:138"/>doubted, but that there will be from time to time many excellent Laws Enacted; yet two I would have paſſed immediately, the one concerning the whole Regulation of the Elections to Parliament, which we need very much, and no doubt but it will be well done; that part of it which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to go hand in hand with our Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and which indeed muſt be part of it, is, that a Parliament be Elected every year at a certain day, and that without any Writ or Summons, the People Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of courſe at the time appointed in the uſual place (as they do in Pariſhes at the Church-Houſe to chuſe Officers) and that the Sheriffs be there ready to preſide and to certifie the Election. And that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſo Choſen ſhall Meet at the time appointed, and Sit and Adjuorn as their buſineſs is more or leſs urgent: But ſtill ſetting yet a time for their coming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again; but if there ſhall be a neceſſity (by reaſon of Invaſion or ſome other Cauſe) for their Aſſembling ſooner, then the King to Call the Councellors of theſe Four Councels all together, and with the conſent of the major part of them, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <pb n="270" facs="tcp:107138:139"/>their Meeting ſooner; but when the day day comes for the Annual Meeting of Another Parliament, they muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to be Diſſolved in Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Ceremony, and the new one to take their place.</p>

                  <p>I would have this conſidered too, and provided for, That no Election ſhould be made of any perſon who had not the majority of the Electors preſent to Vote for him; ſo the Writ orders it, and ſo Reaſon dictates; for elſe, how can he be ſaid to repreſent the County, if not a fifth part have conſented to his choice, as happens ſometimes, and may do oftener? for where ſeven or eight ſtand for one vacant place, as I have know in our laſt Long Parliament, where the Votes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet in Columns, he who has had moſt Votes, has not exceeded four hundred of above two thouſand who were preſent.</p>

                  <p>This is very Material, and indeed Eſſential; but I make no doubt, but if this Project ſhould come in play in Parliament, this and all other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars (which would be both needleſs and tedious to diſcourſe of here) will be well and effectually provided for. The next Act I would have paſſed, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Houſe of Peers, that as I take it for granted, that there will be a Clauſe in the Bill concerning Elections, that no new Boroughs ſhall be enabled to ſend Members to Parliament, except they ſhall be capacitated thereunto by an Act; ſo it being of the ſame neceſſity as to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Parliament, that the Peers (who do and muſt enjoy both a Negative and Deliberative Voice in all Parliamentary Tranſactions, except what concern Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying of Money Originally) be exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from depending abſolutely upon the Prince, and that therefore it be declared by Act, for the future, that no Peer ſhall be made but by Act of Parliament, and then that it be Hereditary in his Male Line.</p>

                  <p>I am not yet fully ſatisfied <pb n="272" facs="tcp:107138:140"/>how you can order your Matters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Houſe of Peers, nor do I ſee how the Conteſts between the Houſe of Commons and them, can be ſo laid aſleep but that they will ariſe again: Beſides the Houſe of Commons muſt neceſſarily be extreamly concerned to find the Houſe of Peers, which conſiſts of private perſons, though very great and honourable ones, in an Inſtant daſh all that they have been ſo long hammering for the good of all the People of <hi>England</hi> whom they repreſent; were it not better now, you are upon ſo great alterations, to make an Annual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective Senate, or at leaſt one wherein the Members ſhould be but for Life, and not Hereditary.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Eng. Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>By no means, Sir, the leſs change the better, and in this Caſe the Metaphyſical Maxime is more true than in any, <hi>viz. Entia non ſunt multiplicanda ſine neceſſitate;</hi> for great alterations fright Men, and puzzle them, and there is no need of it at all in this Caſe. I have told you before, that there is a neceſſity of a Senate, and how ſhort this Government would be without it, and how confuſed in
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:107138:140"/>the mean time; the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate was He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary amongſt the <hi>Patricii,</hi> except the Cenſor left any of them out of the Roll during his Magiſtracy, for ſome very great and ſcandalous offence; and in that caſe too there was an Appeal to the People, as in all other Cauſes, witneſs the Caſe of <hi>Lucius Quintius</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others. To ſhew that there can be no need of ſuch a change here as you ſpeak of, you may pleaſe to conſider, that all differences between the ſeveral parts of any Government, come upon the account of Intereſt; now when this Settlement is made, the Houſe of Peers, and the Houſe of Commons, can have no Intereſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; For as to all things of private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, that is, the Rights of Peers, both during the ſitting of Parliaments, and in the Intervals, is left to their own Houſe to judge of, as it is to the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to judge of their own Priviledges; And as for the conteſt of the Peers Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction as to Appeals from Courts of Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; Belides that I would have that ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Act which ſhould paſs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="274" facs="tcp:107138:141"/>the Lords Houſe; I believe it will never happen more, when the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is upon a right Foundation; it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been hitherto fomented by two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parties, the Court-party ſometimes blowing up that difference to break the Seſſion, leſt ſome good Bills for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould paſs, or that the King by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting them, might diſcontent his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; to avoid which <hi>Dilemma,</hi> there needed no more, but to procure ſome perſon to proſecute his Appeal before the Lords; ſome honeſt Patriots afterwards poſſibly might uſe the ſame policy which they learnt from the Courtiers, to quaſh ſome Bill very deſtructive, in which they were out-voted in the Commons Houſe; otherwiſe it is ſo far from the Intereſt of the Commons to hinder Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals from Courts of Equity, that there is none amongſt them, but know we are almoſt deſtroyed for want of it: And when they have conſidered well, and that ſome ſuch Reformation as this ſhall take place; they will find that it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be placed in a more honourable and <pb n="275" facs="tcp:107138:141"/>unbyas'd Judicatory than this; And I could wiſh that even in the Intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Parliamentary Seſſions, the whole Peerage of <hi>England,</hi> as many of them as can conveniently be in Town, may ſit in their Judicial Capacities, and hear Appeals in Equity, as well as Judge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Writs of Errour. Now as to your other Objection (which is indeed of great weight) that the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons muſt needs take it ill, that the Lords ſhould fruſtrate their endeavours for the Peoples good by their Negative; If you conſider one thing, the force of this Objection will vaniſh; which is, That when this new Conſtitution ſhall be admitted, the Lords cannot have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Intereſt or temptation to differ with the Commons, in any thing wherein the Publick good is concerned, but are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by all the ties in the World, to run the ſame courſe and fortune with the Commons, their Intereſt being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the ſame; ſo that if there be any diſſenting upon Bills between the two Houſes, when each of them ſhall think <pb n="276" facs="tcp:107138:142"/>their own Expedient conduces moſt to the advantage of the Publick; this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference will ever be decided by right reaſon at Conferences; And the Lords may as well convince the Commons, as be convinced by them; and theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts are and ever will be of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſe and benefit to the Commonwealth; the reaſon why it is otherwiſe now, and that the Houſe of Peers is made uſe of to hinder many Bills from paſſing, that are ſuppoſed to be for the eaſe of the People, is, that the great Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors and Officers which ſit in that Houſe, do ſuggeſt (whether true or falſe) that it is againſt his Majeſties Will and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt that ſuch an Act ſhould paſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it has found Obſtruction; but here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after if our expedient take place it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo, firſt, becauſe our King himſelf cannot have any deſigns going (as was proved before) which ſhall make it his advantage to hinder any good intended his people, whoſe proſperity then will be his own. And then becauſe in a ſhort time, the Peers being made by
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:107138:142"/>Act of Parliament, will conſiſt of the beſt Men of
<hi>England</hi> both for Parts and Eſtates, and thoſe who are already made, if any of them have ſmall Eſtates, the King if he had the Intereſt, would not have the means to corrupt them, the Publick Moneys, and the great Offices being to be diſpenſed in another manner than formerly; ſo their Lordſhips will have no Motive in the World to ſteer their Votes and Councils, but their own Honour and Conſcience, and the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and proſperity of their Country. So that it would be both needleſs and unjuſt to pretend any change of this kind. Beſides, this alteration in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of our Government being propoſed to be done by the unanimous conſent of King, Lords, and Commons, and not otherwiſe, it would be very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous to believe, that the Peers would depoſe themſelves of their Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Rights, and betake themſelves to the hopes of being Elected; it is true, they have loſt the Power they had over the Commons, but that has not been <pb n="279" facs="tcp:107138:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>taken from them by any Law, no more than it was given them by any; but is fallen by the courſe of Nature, as has been ſhewn at large; But though they cannot lead the Commons by their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures, as formerly, yet there is no reaſon or colour that they ſhould loſe their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination, which I am ſure they have by Law, and by the Fundamental Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Government; and which is ſo far from being prejudicial to a laſting Settlement (as was ſaid) that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely contributes to it, and prevents the Confuſion which would deſtroy it. If I ſhould have propoſed any thing in this Diſcourſe which ſhould have Intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the King's Hereditary Right, or that ſhould have hindred the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Greatneſs of theſe Kingdoms from being repreſented by his Royal Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I ſhould have made your Story of the <hi>Capuchine</hi> Fryar very Applicable to me.</p>

                  <p>It is ſo in Democracies, and was ſo in <hi>Sparta,</hi> and is done by your Great Council in <hi>Venice;</hi> but we are not making ſuch a kind of Government, but rectifying an ancient Monarchy, and giving the Prince ſome help in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of that great Branch of his Regality; beſides, it is ſufficient, that our Parliament chuſes theſe Councils, (that is always underſtood the Lords and Commons, with the Kings Conſent) beſides, it is poſſible, that if ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation as this come in Debate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, the Parliament will reſerve to it ſelf the Approbation of the Great Officers, as Chancellor, Judges, General Officers of an Army, and the like; and that ſuch ſhall not have a ſettlement in thoſe Charges, till they are according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb n="280" facs="tcp:107138:144"/>allowed of; but may in the mean time exerciſe them. As to particulars, I ſhall always refer you to what the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament will judge fit to Order in the Caſe; but if you have any thing to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or to ſhew in general, that ſome ſuch Regulation as this cannot be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al towards the putting our Diſtracted Country into better Order; I ſhall think my ſelf oblig'd to Anſwer you, if you can have Patience to hear me, and are not weary already; as you may very well be.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall certainly never be weary of ſuch Diſcourſe; however I ſhall give you no further trouble in this matter; for I am very fully ſatisfied, that ſuch Reformation, if it could be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed, would not only Unite all Parties, but make you very Flouriſhing at home, and very Great abroad: but have you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hopes that ſuch a thing will ever come into Debate? what do the Parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſay to it?</p>

                  <p>I never had any Diſcourſe to this purpoſe, either with any Lord, or Member of the Commons houſe, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than as poſſibly ſome of theſe Notions might fall in at Ordinary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: For I do not intend to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench upon the Office of God, to teach our Senatours Wiſdom. I have known ſome men ſo full of their own Notions, that they went up and down ſputtering them in every Mans Face they met; ſome went to Great Men during our late troubles; nay, to the King himſelf, to offer their Expedients from Revelation. Two Men I was acquainted with, of which one had an Invention to reconcile differences in Religion; the other had a project for a Bank of Lands to lye as a Security for ſumms of Money lent; both theſe were Perſons of Great Parts and Fancy; but yet ſo troubleſome at all Times, and in all Companies, that I have often been forced to repeat an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Proverb of your Country: God deliver me from a man that has but one buſineſs; and I aſſure you there is no <pb n="282" facs="tcp:107138:145"/>Mans Reputation that I envy leſs, than I do that of ſuch Perſons; and therefore you may pleaſe to believe that I have not imitated them in ſcattering theſe Notions, nor can I Propheſie whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Apprehenſions as theſe will ever come into the Heads of thoſe men who are our true Phyſitians. But yet to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer your Queſtion, and give you my Conjecture; I believe that we are not Ripe yet for any great Reform; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe we are a very Debauch'd Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; I do not only mean that we are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Whoring, Drinking, Gaming and Idleneſs; but chiefly that we have a Politique Debauch, which is a neglect of all things that concern the publick welfare, and a ſetting up our own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt againſt it; I ſay, this is not all, for then the Polity of no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try could be Redreſt: For every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth that is out of order, has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all theſe Debauches we ſpeak of, as Conſequences of their looſe State. But there are two other Conſiderations which induce me to fear that our Cure is <pb n="283" facs="tcp:107138:145"/>not yet near. The firſt is, becauſe moſt of the Wiſe and Grave Men of this Kingdom are very ſilent, and will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their Budget upon any terms: and although they diſlike the preſent Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are in as much as any Men, and ſee the Precipice it leads us to, yet will never open their Mouths to preſcribe a Cure; but being asked what they would adviſe, give a ſhrug like your Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. There was a very conſiderable Gentleman as moſt in <hi>England,</hi> both for Birth, Parts, and Eſtate, who being a Member of the Parliament that was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, 1640. continued all the War with them; and by his Wiſdom and Eloquence (which were both very great) promoted very much their Affairs. When the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons began between the Presbyters and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents, he joyned Cordially with the latter, ſo far as to give his Affirmative to the Vote of No Addreſſes; that is, to an Order made in the Houſe of Commons, to ſend no more Meſſages to the King, nor to receive any from him. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when an Aſſault was made upon
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:107138:146"/>the Houſe by the Army, and divers of the Members taken violently away, and Secluded; he diſliking it (though he were none of them) voluntarily abſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, and continued retired; being exceedingly averſe to a Democratical Government, which was then declared for, till
<hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Uſurpation; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinitely courted by him, abſolutely refuſed to accept of any Employment under him, or to give him the leaſt Counſel. When <hi>Cromwell</hi> was dead, and a Parliament called by his Son, or rather by the Army, the chief Officers of which did, from the beginning, whiſper into the Ears of the Leading Members, that if they could make an honeſt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſhould be ſtood by (as the Word then was) by the Army. This Gentleman, at that time, neither would be Elected into that Parliament, nor give the leaſt Advice to any other Perſon that was; but kept himſelf ſtill upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. Inſomuch that it was generally believed, that although he had ever been oppoſite to the late King's coming to the <pb n="285" facs="tcp:107138:146"/>Government again, though upon Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions; yet he might hanker after the Reſtoration of His Majeſty that now is. But that Apprehenſion appeared ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when it came to the pinch: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſulted as an Oracle by the then General <hi>Monk,</hi> whether he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Monarchy again or no, would make no Anſwer, nor give him the leaſt Advice; and, <hi>de facto,</hi> hath ever ſince kept himſelf from Publick Buſineſs; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, upon the Baniſhment of my Lord of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> he was viſited by one of the Greateſt Perſons in <hi>England,</hi> and one in as much Eſteem with His Majeſty as any whatſoever, and deſired to accept of ſome great Employment near the King; which he abſolutely refuſing, the ſame Perſon, not a Stranger to him, but well known by him, begged of him to give his Advice how His Majeſty (who deſired nothing more than to unite all his People together, and repair the Breaches which the Civil War had cauſed, now my Lord <hi>Clarendon</hi> was gone, who by his Counſels kept thoſe Wounds open) might <pb n="286" facs="tcp:107138:147"/>perform that Honourable and Gracious Work: but ſtill this Gentleman made his Excuſes. And, in ſhort, neither then, nor at any time before or after (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he ſate in the Long Parliament of the Year 40.) neither during the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Times, nor ſince His Majeſty's Return, when they ſeemed more repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, would ever be brought, either by any private intimate Friend, or by any Perſon in Publick Employment, to give the leaſt Judgment of our Affairs, or the leaſt Counſel to mend them, though he was not ſhye of declaring his diſlike of Matters as they went. And yet this Gentleman was not only by repute, and eſteem a wiſe Man, but was really ſo, as it appeared by his management of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and drawing Declarations, when he was contented to act; as alſo by his exceeding prudent managing of his own Fortune, which was very great, and his honourable Living and providing for his Family; his Daughters having been all Marryed to the beſt Men in <hi>England;</hi> and his Eldeſt Son to the moſt accompliſht <pb n="287" facs="tcp:107138:147"/>Lady in the World. I dare aſſure you, there are above an hundred ſuch Men in <hi>England,</hi> though not altogether of that eminency.</p>

                  <p>Methinks theſe perſons are altogether as bad an extreme as the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacious men you ſpoke of hefore. I remember when I went to School, our Maſter, amongſt other Common-places in the commendation of ſilence, would tell us of a Latine ſaying, That a Fool whilſt he held his peace did not differ from a Wiſe man; but truly I think we may as truly ſay, That a wiſe man whilſt he is ſilent does not differ from a Fool; for how great ſoever his Wiſdom is, it can neither get him credit, nor otherwiſe advantage himſelf, his Friend, nor his Country. But let me not divert you from your other point.</p>

                  <speaker>Eng. Gent.</speaker>
                  <p>The next Reaſon I have to make me fear that ſuch an Expedient as we have been talking of, will not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſuddenly, is the great diſtruſt the <pb n="288" facs="tcp:107138:148"/>Parliament has of men, which will make moſt Members ſhy of venturing at ſuch matters, which being very new, at the firſt motion are not perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, at leaſt to ſuch as have not been verſed in Authors who have written of the Politicks; and therefore the Mover may be ſuſpected of having been ſet on by the Court-party to puzzle them, and ſo to divert, by offering new Expedients, ſome ſmart mettleſome Debates they may be upon concerning the Succeſſion to the Crown, or other high matters: For it is the nature of all Popular Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels (even the wiſeſt that ever were, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the people of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Athens,</hi> which <hi>Michiavil</hi> ſo much extols) in turbulent times, to like diſcourſes that heighten their paſſions, and blow up their Indignation, better than them that endeavour to rectifie their Judgments, and tend to provide for their ſafety. And the truth is, our Parliament is very much to be excuſed, or rather juſtified in this diſtruſt they have of perſons, ſince there hath been of late ſo many and ſo ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <pb n="289" facs="tcp:107138:148"/>attempts uſed by the late great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, to debauch the moſt eminent Members of the Commons-Houſe, by Penſions and Offices; and therefore it would wonderfully conduce to the good of the Common-wealth, and to the compoſing our diſordered State, if there were men of ſo high and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable a Reputation, that they were above all ſuſpicion and diſtruſt, and ſo might venture upon bold, that is (in this caſe) moderate Counſels, for the ſaving of their Country. Such men there were in the Parliament of 1640. at leaſt twenty or thirty, who having ſtood their ground in ſeven Parliaments before, which in the two laſt Kings Reigns had been diſſolved abruptly and in wrath, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the fear of Impriſonment and great Fines for their love to <hi>England,</hi> as well, as the temptation of Money and Offices to betray it, both inferred by the wicked Councellours of that Age, tending both to the ruine of our juſt Rights, and the detriment of their <pb n="290" facs="tcp:107138:149"/>Maſters Affairs; I ſay, having conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with great magnanimity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour made proof of their Integrity, they had acquired ſo great a Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that not only the Parliament, but even almoſt the whole People ſtuck to them, and were ſwayed by them in Actions of a much higher Nature than any are now diſcourſed of, without fear of being deſerted, or as we ſay, left in the lurch, as the people of
<hi>France</hi> often are by their Grandees, when they raiſe little Civil Wars to get great Places, which as ſoon as they are offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they lay down Arms, and leave their Followers to be hang'd; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe two reaſons of the ſilence of ſome wiſe men, and the want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in others, does give us but a ſad proſpect of our Land of Promiſe, yet we have one Conſideration, which does incourage us to hope better things ere long. And that is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Certainty that we cannot long Continue as we are, and that we can never Meliorate, but by ſome ſuch
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:107138:149"/>Principles, as we have been here all this while diſcourſing of, and that without ſuch helps and ſuccours as may be drawn from thence, we muſt go from one diſtraction to another, till we come into a Civil War, and in the cloſe of it be certainly a prey to the King of
<hi>France,</hi> who (on which ſide it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not) will be a Gameſter, and ſweep Stakes at laſt; the World not being now equally ballanced between two Princes alike powerful, as it was during our laſt Civil War; and if as well this danger, as the only means to prevent it, be underſtood in time, (as no doubt it will) we ſhall be the happieſt and the greateſt Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the World in a little time; and in the mean time, enjoy the beſt and moſt juſt eaſie Government of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People upon Earth. If you ask me whether I could have offer'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that I thought better than this, I will anſwer you as <hi>Solon</hi> did a Philoſopher, who askt him whether he could not have made a better <pb n="292" facs="tcp:107138:150"/>Government for <hi>Athens?</hi> Yes, but that his was the beſt, that the People would or could receive. And now I believe you will bear me witneſs, that I have not treated you as a Wiſe man would have done in ſilence; but it is time to put an end to this tittle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tattle which has nauſeated you for three days together.</p>
